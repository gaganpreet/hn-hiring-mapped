(Mostly Stanford, Google, Y Combinator folks) We've learned a ton, and see an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people - we've started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.\nIn the last 6 months, we've launched 2 major projects:</p><p>- App 2.0, the new insurance application for healthcare.gov. It's processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.</p><p>- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor. It's now saving the taxpayer $70M in annual maintenance costs.</p><p>Here's a Wired article from last summer about us: <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/</a></p><p>We're just starting on a few major new projects that have a huge potential to improve our government. We have the technical experience to do things the right way, and the relationships and trust inside government agencies to get things done. Our momentum is strong, the problem is important, and we're looking for good people.</p><p>If you're the type that would get fired up about reimagining broken government experiences and technology, please drop us a line at jobs@navahq.com, we'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Specifically, we\u2019re looking for:</p><p>- a product manager with a technical background</p><p>- a senior devops engineer</p><p>- a senior full-stack engineer</p></font>\n              ",

You will be in charge of writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect utility data from utilities. Often these utility data formats are complex and unique to each utility (pdf bills, xml data, csv data, etc.), so you will need to be very clever in collecting and parsing a huge variety of formats. Also, these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important.

We're looking for SENIOR engineers with experience and interest in distributed systems. DevOps is a smaller part of what we do, but experience is a plus.</p><p>About Sauce:\nSauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don't have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids. We pride ourselves about our values and transparency (<a href=\"https://saucelabs.com/our-values\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://saucelabs.com/our-values</a>). Oh, and a nice to have these days: we have a real business model!</p><p>About the Team:\nOur CORE team is currently 8 people and we plan to grow in a controlled fashion this year, hiring only excellent people who are excited about what we do. Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location. We build a highly available service that runs thousands of customer Selenium tests in real time using VMs hosted in our own infrastructure. We own all our hardware and we collaborate tightly with our Ops team to manage it.</p><p>About our Stack:\nSauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we're currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level (Go is a clear option).

Think Airbnb, Zillow, or Trulia, but to find your company an office. The commercial real estate space is <i>massive</i>. To compare: $48 billion in VC money was handed out in 2014... and there was $957 billion in commercial real estate leasing and purchases. Our average signup is worth over over $100.  Commercial real estate's current technology is antiquated\u2014finding an office is as difficult as residential house hunting circa 2004. We're changing that.</p><p>We're now at six people. We've operated for the last year in Nashville, TN as a test market. Me (tech), my two cofounders with commercial real estate backgrounds, and three employees we've hired to handle local brokerage work as business has expanded in Nashville. You'd be our first tech hire. Our pay is competitive as fuck and you'll get a good chunk of equity.</p><p>We're expanding to LA (Irvine) and Dallas this month. We're hiring in LA.</p><p>Technology: React and Flux on ES6 frontend, Django/Python backend with Postgres.</p><p>There's a really broad variety of skills that we need, so say hello if you're at all curious. If you have tech chops and have done management or recruiting before that's a strong plus. SEO experience, awesome. We're also finance nerds, so there's a world for creativity there.</p><p><a href=\"http://tenantbase.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tenantbase.com</a></p><p>Email me at andy@tenantbase.com</p><p>Or text me at 734 545-8789 and just say that you're from HN and curious about the job.

We want you to join hands with the rest of our tech team and deliver production code.  Just like everyone else, you'll pull a new bug/feature from the queue, work with anyone else necessary (e.g. our world-class designer, Joe) and put together a pull request.  I'll be a personal resource and I'm dedicated to learning and to teaching.  If you hit a snag or don't know the best way to do something, we'll work on it together.<p>We are a collaborative team.  We count on everyone to think critically, bring ideas for improvements and champion those ideas.  In other words, \"We <i>do</i> pay you to think.\"  Be a part of designing our product and our business.</p><p>WHERE IS THIS PLACE?\nI'm currently our entire Boston office (there are another half a dozen of us at the home office in Chicago and one on the West coast).  On that account, we don't have a permanent office here yet.  I'm planning to spend the summer working from co-working spaces, coffee shops, home, and places in the sun.  I like to alternate between working surrounded by great people and taking a full day somewhere quiet to knock out some \"real work\" (writing code).

Despite the explosion of experimental data, we do not comprehensively understand how phenotype arises from genotype. Our approach is to develop computational models which predict how behavior emerges from the molecular level by integrating diverse data into a single model. Our goal is to use models to make medicine more precise and personalized by predicting disease progression and drug responses. We are also using our models to engineer bacteria. Our research is highly interdisciplinary involving computational modeling, software engineering, data visualization and curation. We have close collaborations with several experimental groups to build and test our models.</p><p>Responsibilities: The candidate will be responsible for developing human and bacterial whole-cell models for precision cancer medicine and synthetic biology. This will include expanding the scope of whole-cell models, incorporating new sources of high-throughput genomic data, and improving the accuracy of whole-cell models. The candidate will work closely with experimental cancer collaborators at Mount Sinai, as well as with Luis Serrano's laboratory at the Center for Regulatory Genomics in Barcelona, Spain.</p><p>Desired skills/experience: The ideal candidate has the following skills. Applicants with deep experience in related fields are also encouraged to apply. \n- Deep experience in dynamical and genome-scale modeling, software engineering, data visualization, and databases; \n- Strong knowledge of biology, physics, mathematics, and computation; \n- Several years experience in computational systems biology is a plus; \n- Excellent object-oriented programming skills in Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript; \n- Ability to learn new skills and concepts; - Excellent oral and written communication skills; and \n- Abilities to work independently and within a team effort.</p><p>More information: Please visit our website (<a href=\"http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.mssm.edu/karr/join.html</a>) or contact Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).</p><p>How to apply: Please send a cover letter indicating your research and career goals, a CV, and 2-3 letters of reference to Jonathan Karr (karr@mssm.edu).</p></font>\n              ",

Above all else, we're looking for others who are as excited about the potential in this space as we are, and who will be willing to join us in moving fast and breaking things as we execute against that vision.</p></font>\n              ",

Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities. We\u2019re a really small team (currently 13 people) so you\u2019ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.</p><p>We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We\u2019re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we\u2019re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We\u2019re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let's save each other's time). In addition we\u2019re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.</p><p>---</p><p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local.

Last year we powered ~1500 events, and are estimating powering 5000-7000 events this year.</p><p>All Jobs - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html</a>\nAndroid Developer - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oyNYXfw0,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oyNYXfw0,Job&amp;jvs=Ha...</a>\nData Engineer - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=ohp8Zfwx,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=ohp8Zfwx,Job&amp;jvs=Ha...</a>\nDevOps Engineer - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html</a>?\nnl=1&amp;jvi=oWFw0fwR,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\nEngineering Intern - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oniPZfwd,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oniPZfwd,Job&amp;jvs=Ha...</a>\niOS Developer - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=ovNYXfwX,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=ovNYXfwX,Job&amp;jvs=Ha...</a>\nSoftware Developer - <a href=\"http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oGNYXfw8,Job&amp;jvs=Hacker_News\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://doubledutch.me/jobs.html?nl=1&amp;jvi=oGNYXfw8,Job&amp;jvs=Ha...</a></p></font>\n              ",

We're also using CoffeeScript, Sass, D3.js, Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine, and Redis. The team in place consists of four Engineers who have been working with Angular for about 18 months and Rails for anywhere from 18 mos - 3 years. We started development on the application in November 2013 and worked/learned alongside three consultants from thoughtbot for the first six months (thru initial launch). In the time since we've continued to enhance the product, which is rapidly emerging as a leader in the market.</p><p>In 2015 we expect to spend some time focusing on scaling the product - it's currently deployed to fifteen clients of varying sizes, but we expect to add a handful more (and thus, many new users) to the application each month this summer. Based on what's near the top of our product roadmap, we're also expecting a few complex data modeling challenges. While the team in place is definitely up to the challenge, we'd love to add some technical leadership to the team. As such, we're hoping to find someone with experience on Rails and Javascript frameworks (preferably Angular), experience scaling enterprise applications, and a commitment to testing/quality.</p><p>Some perks of the position include a flexible schedule (WFH when you need to, work late one day/leave early the next, etc), dedicated investment time (work on trainings, side projects, open source, etc. for at least one day/month), snacks, pet-friendly office, company-sponsored events (we just spent a long weekend in Stowe, VT), and kick-ass teammates (at least we think so)!</p><p>You can apply for this position at the link below, or feel free to reach out to missy.carroll [at] arcadiasolutions.com with any questions.</p><p><a href=\"https://careers-arcadiasolutions.icims.com/jobs/1369/principal-software-engineer/job\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://careers-arcadiasolutions.icims.com/jobs/1369/princip...</a></p><p>Hope to hear from some of you!</p></font>\n              ",

But cool :)</p><p>GDC (<a href=\"http://www.gothamdreamcars.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gothamdreamcars.com</a>) is an ultra-exotic car rental company.  I started it about 11 years ago and have built it organically to a multi-city company renting out some of the coolest cars on earth.</p><p>A few years ago I dove headfirst into the tech side of things, taught myself to code, and built our entire tech stack myself - and it now runs the whole company.  But I'm focused on other things these days and don't have the time to maintain / continue to develop the site, so it's time to bring someone on board to handle it.</p><p>It's not the most world-changing stuff -- essentially a CRUD app with a consumer-facing front-end and admin-facing back-end for managing the fleet, booking reservations, doing light CRM, billing, logistics, etc.  But it's incredibly satisfying to work on -- every feature directly helps the employees in the office work more efficiently, helps the cars get booked more often, and helps our customers stay happy.  It's step-by-step replacing manual processes and has a huge impact on the company, employees and customers.</p><p>If you're looking for some satisfying part-time, remote Rails/Frontend work and are interested in directly improving an interesting business that deals with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, this might be ideal for you.  There's zero overhead here -- if you have an idea for a feature, you can go ahead code it up and push it live that day.</p><p>You don't have to be a senior Rails or JavaScript expert - you just have to be better than I am ;) (I'm a solid intermediate.)</p><p>There's a long list of fun features on my to-do list, so the first few weeks/months would be more involved as you bang out updates and get things caught up, then it would transition to maintenance, new features, new ideas, etc. over time.</p><p>A bit about our stack and some of the tasks at hand:</p><p>* Rails (currently on 3.2, moving to 4.x)</p><p>* MongoDB (but that's gotta go, so we're moving to Postgres)</p><p>* Stylus for CSS</p><p>* Haml / Slim for HTML templates</p><p>* JavaScript (currently mess of jQuery - TBD which framework we'll move to)</p><p>* Git-based workflow</p><p>If this sounds interesting/fun, take a look at the site, shoot me an email (contact info in HN profile) and we'll discuss.</p></font>\n              ",

Our first sensor network is for wireless signal [1] where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch. We are hiring for all manner of different roles right not (DevOps, Android, Frontend, UX/UI &amp; data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills.

The news all too often brings word of yet another compromise, exposing financial information, personal details, or simply salacious pictures.  Whatever the impact, it's clear the technology industry has a problem, and there are few easy solutions.</p><p>Some seek legislation to impose harsher penalties on the responsible parties.  This ignores the fact that many of those responsible are outside the jurisdictions which seek to punish them.  In some cases, they may have tacit approval of their own government, or even be operating on their government's behalf.  Others turn to established security products looking for antivirus and network filtering technologies to add protection.  This is an also an imperfect solution.  It places the defender in a reactive posture, responding only to those threats which have been previously detected, and for which countermeasures have been developed.  There's no perfect solutions.</p><p>At Matasano, we believe the best way to combat security weaknesses is at their source; by discovering and remediating software vulnerabilities before others leverage them for ill effect.  Our clients see the value in this approach.  We're engaged to work on some of the most interesting and important software on the planet.  Aside from identifying vulnerabilities, we help our clients identify the root cause.  Through this, they can adjust processes to reduce the likelihood of similar problems in the future, while increasing their ability to identify and correct them.  The goal is more resilient software.</p><p>We've assessed hot startup web applications, low level device firmware, mobile platforms, and everything in between.  With this breadth, we have need for employees skilled in frameworks like Node, Rails, Django, and Spring.  We need people comfortable with x86 and ARM assembly, reverse engineering, and binary protocol analysis.  If you're skilled in a programming language with the letter 'C' in it, that's desirable.  Newer safer languages like Rust and Golang are in demand.  In short if you share our focus on helping secure our software ecosystem one piece at a time and want a chance to do something about it, we should talk.</p><p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=\"http://www.matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com\nGet a taste for some of what we do at <a href=\"http://www.microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cryptopals.com</a>\nCheck out our blog at <a href=\"http://chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chargen.matasano.com</a></p><p>Next month, you'll notice a change in these posts.

We believe that what we're working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle's past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors' notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We've raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.</p><p>If you're interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we're a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.</p><p>We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world.\nWe're working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We're also looking for MD/PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together. In addition, we\u2019re looking for a senior business development person.</p><p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http://www.enlitic.com/team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.enlitic.com/team.html</a> .

We're a small contract engineering firm located just outside Louisville, in Greenville, Indiana. We focus on high-tech development, with most of our contracts coming from the government. We do a ton of work for NASA, DoD, NHS, and others, in addition to corporate and start-up clients.</p><p>We've been in business for 25 years, sent multiple payloads up on the Space Shuttle, built several new medical devices, and spun off a business making rugged LED lighting. We recently sent a payload up to the ISS, and we're under contract to deliver several more! With only 36 employees, it's a great work environment, with lots of schedule flexibility, and freedom to \"go your own direction\" with projects. We're currently looking to fill two positions: A Software Engineer and a Machinist.</p><p>Machinist Posting (<a href=\"http://techshot.com/documents/Machinist%20Posting%201_19_15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techshot.com/documents/Machinist%20Posting%201_19_15....</a>)</p><p>Looking for a general purpose machinist who can turn parts around rapidly when necessary. We shop out a lot of stuff, but sometimes we need to make things quick. If you have less experience than requested, but can demonstrate the ability to learn quickly, it's still worth applying.</p><p>Software Engineer Posting (<a href=\"http://techshot.com/documents/Software%20Engineer%203_13_15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techshot.com/documents/Software%20Engineer%203_13_15....</a>)</p><p>Any software engineer would need to be reasonably comfortable with low-level interfacing with hardware. Embedded development experience a huge plus. Our software interacts with lower-level embedded device we've developed in-house, giving users a nice front-end interface, and offloading some of the heavy computational lifting.</p><p>I'm an Electrical Engineer here, and I can pretty confidently say that it's a great job for a technically curious engineer. There isn't a lot of opportunity to move \"up the management chain\" within the company, but the work environment is super-flexible, the projects are technically interesting and challenging, and the current team is intelligent and motivated.</p><p>If you have any questions about the company, job postings, or would like to submit your resume/cover letter, send me an email, bluyster@techshot.com.</p></font>\n              ",

At present we all work core hours in London time, give or take a few hours.\nWe're hiring mid-level developers -- full-stack, really (we're all full-stack more or less!) but we've notice we're weaker on front end, so we'll be particularly interested if you have solid experience with some of these: strong cross-browser support (we have to support more than the \"evergreen\" browsers), i18n (we can't assume text length is constant, or even RTL...), multi-device/resolution support, accessibility, jQuery for auto-save and that sort of thing; HighCharts for graphing.<p>For the rest of the stack: Java experience is important; beyond that, we can generally show you around (more below).  We're mostly a Java enterprise stack, actively rebuilding and splitting up functions, actually. Recently we've scripted the setup of the entire stack (or individual servers), including using Vagrant to easily set up a complete environment locally for each developer.</p><p><i>More about PKB</i></p><p>I've worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.</p><p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.</p><p>We're building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable. If you're interested in PKB's growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I'm the CTO.</p><p>We're pragmatic about work/life balance. I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live. Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I get my kids up in the morning, sometimes see them at lunchtime, then take over late-afternoon &amp; evening (while my wife works), and I fill in a bit of extra working time around the edges as needed. We're collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what's effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall. One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he's also a theatre director.</p><p>Culture -- we're live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, and Vienna; we range in age (though I don't actually know everyone's ages, so I can't say exactly!). We're not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn't catch something. We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we're on the same team. We're not the sort of group to tell dirty jokes, or tales of how drunk we got last weekend; though we do have interesting stories to share.</p><p>If we sound like a good match, get in touch: <a href=\"https://patients.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://patients.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=4</a> (I'm also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email).</p></font>\n              ",
