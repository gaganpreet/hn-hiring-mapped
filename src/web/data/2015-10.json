We write scripts that collect data from utilities, and these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. We recently got a large grant from the Department of Energy and closed a round of funding, so we have lots of runway. We are currently a team of six located downtown Oakland, and we are expanding rapidly.<p>=Job Description=<p>You will be helping test&#x2F;maintain&#x2F;monitor&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;scale the stack. Our current codebase is well organized, documented, and tested, and we will be adding compatibility for many new utilities over the next few years. We need to make sure our product stays top notch as we add utilities. You will have to visit Oakland periodically for all-hands meetings.<p>=Requirements=<p>* At least 6 years of Python stack and Linux devops experience<p>* Experienced with: AWS, django, celery, redis, postgres<p>* U.S. citizen or green card<p>=How To Apply=<p>Email me, Daniel Roesler, a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org).<p>=For Solar Skeptics=<p>In the last few years, the solar industry reached &quot;grid parity&quot;, which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That&#x27;s why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn&#x27;t some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).",

We don&#x27;t believe security products should be a game of &quot;select 2&quot; in the set of {real security, usability, stability}.<p>- What we need -\nWe&#x27;re looking for 1-2 more django peeps with decent security knowledge to come help me build out new features in our Django backend. Do you like self-documenting APIs and inception-like encrypted encryption keys? You&#x27;re probably who I&#x27;m looking for. Even if you aren&#x27;t exactly writing your own encryption algorithms, I still want to talk to you! Security is a mindset, not a finite set of knowledge.<p>- How to get in touch - \nI&#x27;m not going to make you submit your resume to a website. I just want to talk to you for 10-15 mins.<p>Email me (ryan@thinair.com) and we can arrange a time to talk - either in-person over coffee or over the phone.<p>Be prepared to answer one very simple question - &quot;What was the last cool thing you worked on, and why was it cool?&quot;<p>Cheers!\nRyan",

Candidates should also have a strong sense for UI&#x2F;UX.<p>The key issues that you will face are:<p>-Presenting a new metric: Predictive CLV is a new metric that has never been accessible before. The success of its penetration depends critically on effective communication to our clients.<p>-Visualization of massive data sets: We need to present output from millions of customers and billions of transactions in an elegant and simple-to-understand fashion.<p>-Design for different stakeholders: We need dashboards and visualizations appropriate for a range of audiences from performance marketers to the C-suite.<p>If these engineering challenges excite you, please contact justin@clvmetrics.com.",

Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We\u2019re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we\u2019re using: Dropwizard, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We\u2019re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time). In addition we\u2019re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.<p>---<p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local. We offer an integrated social, web, and email marketing solution designed to help merchants get more customers and keep them coming back by spreading word of mouth, extending their customer service, managing their online reputation, and leveraging the Main Street Hub\u2019s merchant network.

It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>I spent 7 months on secondment to Cloud Foundry, coming across from Pivotal Labs, and it was awesome. Platforms of this scope and importance are created once in a generation, and I got to be part of it. You can too.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance.<p>At the office we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>My time at Pivotal, in both Labs and CF, is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had -- I&#x27;ve learnt more here than anywhere else. Everyone is smart and fun to work with.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.  You can also email me at jchester@pivotal.io to answer any questions you might have and potentially help me score one of our generous referral bonuses.<p>Please note that emailing me confers no particular advantage over applying directly and I might not refer you. As a consultant I can only reply to emails during non-billable hours, I hope that&#x27;s OK.<p>I also posted an ad for Pivotal Labs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10311637\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10311637</a>",

We&#x27;d love for you take a few minutes away from sewing that &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;, and to consider a career with NCC Group!<p>NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team. If you\u2019re a tinkerer, a breaker rather than a builder, or someone who wonders \u201cwhy\u201d and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we\u2019d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer. All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time.

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure! E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill). Please include in either the e-mail or the DM at least one commit (repo+SHA) from one of our open source projects that stirs you at some level:  something you found interesting, or inspiring, or unspeakably vile -- or perhaps even all three!  Starting points are the &quot;sdc&quot;, &quot;manta&quot; and &quot;illumos-joyent&quot; repos on GitHub.",

We&#x27;re slowly hiring mid-level and senior full stack developers (one every couple of months), but our next hire or two will be focused on app dev!  We have patient and clinician apps that need to be re-worked and greatly expanded (to navigate a diverse medical record), and we&#x27;ve been working for a while now on a maternity app that takes the midwives and mother all the way through a pregnancy.  That app is based on AppGyver Steroids (which in turn is built around Cordova), so you should be able to jump into that fairly easily.  We&#x27;re thus working with JavaScript, WebSQL, jQuery, backbone, HTML&#x2F;CSS.  Extra points if you&#x27;ve dealt with large&#x2F;complex apps and managing data offline (and the complexity that comes with synching periodically with the server, where new data may come from either the app or the server);<p>For the server side -- apps authenticate with OAuth2, speaking JSON to a REST API; our server-side back end and webapp are primarily Java-based, gradually being refactoring towards a microservice structure.  So if you&#x27;re interested in helping out as well implementing new REST calls as needed, Java experience will ease that path.<p>More about PKB<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.<p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.<p>We&#x27;re building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable. If you&#x27;re interested in PKB&#x27;s growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I&#x27;m in the CTO role.<p>We&#x27;re pragmatic about work&#x2F;life balance. I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live. Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I get my kids up in the morning, and I&#x27;m with them entirely late-afternoon &amp; evening (while my wife works), then I fill in some extra hours around the edges as needed. We&#x27;re collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what&#x27;s effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall. One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he&#x27;s also a theatre director.<p>Culture -- we live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, Vienna, Budapest, NYC and Costa Rica; we range in age (though I don&#x27;t actually know everyone&#x27;s ages, so I can&#x27;t say exactly!). We&#x27;re not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn&#x27;t catch something. We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we&#x27;re on the same team. We like to laugh (but jokes stay tasteful), we share stories of what we did over the weekend (but these don&#x27;t normally end &quot;then I passed out&quot;).<p>If we sound like a good match, get in touch: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html</a> (I&#x27;m also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email).

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. I am posting this from a cafe in Siem Reap right nowwww.<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 14 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> .

(Yes, I know ad-blocking is all the rage these days.  Come be part of the solutions by enabling sensible display ads.)  We&#x27;re looking for a savvy individual who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.<p>You&#x27;ll be working alongside a tight, driven team right in the heart of the profit center. Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through real time bidding, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>#About Connexity:<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unconstrained vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>#Position 1: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.\nThis role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible<p>We need someone to help our Data Science team operations. You&#x27;ll help us maintain and activate various data-driven ad targeting. For example, a client may provide us a billion records which we need to analyze and transform into an audience segment. This isn&#x27;t a software engineering position, but you&#x27;ll want to be (or learn to be) pretty capable at the command line, and able to work with Python&#x2F;Bash or other scripting languages. More than anything, we want someone who can maintain order among various client-facing tasks. On paper, we have a neat structured process; in reality, we need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward. If you like combing through data in Excel, R or similar, this might be a great fit. If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to get your hands on large amounts of data from an analysis or management perspective, please reach out to us.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",
