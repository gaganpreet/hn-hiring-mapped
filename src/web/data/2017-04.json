The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, backend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team.

A PoC of an early version of the idea was featured here on HN 3 years ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386</a>. Time has passed since then and the idea, and technologies required for building it, have evolved. It is my belief the time for this idea, from a market-perspective, has arrived.<p>The service will be designed to improve the process of integrating a company&#x27;s API product with channel partners, either on-prem or in a hosted manner, with the intent to increase pass-through revenue on the API calls a company provides, while providing a simple federated layer based on blochchain backed data structures. This idea is in pre-funding, so I&#x27;m explicitly stating anyone interested in my idea should consider their founder-level involvement as purely self-choice driven. Influencing, making or removing choice for you in this regard is illogical and irrational, given the state of the company (non-existent) and funding (also non-existent). However, if you hold the view that the existing methods for securing the Internet&#x27;s infrastructure are woefully inadequate and you feel applying cryptocurrency to APIs could make companies more money by securing them against use by limiting calls with payments, then you should contact me and we should have a conversation about it.<p>Expertise in building scalable API calls with microservices-based architecture is desired, but a more general gift in development is also welcome. I code in Python, Javascript and C++, and am decently good at running infrastructure, given my history. My primary function is strategy, operations and architecture. I do not visualize, so I tend to communicate differently.<p>My email address is in my profile here on HN. Happy to just discuss the idea, if you are interested, as opposed to any expectation of finding someone this early on to join me.<p>If you&#x27;ve read this far, I appreciate you. I will note that this idea can be applied to AI in a less than obvious way. This reason is the primary purpose of the project, but making revenue in other ways first remains important.",

Although this group of 4 has a great deal of industry experience, we&#x27;ve only worked together in this capacity for about a year. This means that there&#x27;s still a lot of opportunity and green-field work ahead of us.\nThe position could be described as a Sr. Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. We work with billions of records per day and small hundreds of thousands of (messy!) features. We primarily use Scala&#x2F;Spark and Python, but we employ R, Ruby, plain old SQL and other tools on a regular basis.<p>We&#x27;d like to find someone familiar with Bayesian systems, Random Forest and other classification. Experience in ad-tech, e-commerce or online retail is a plus, but we strongly favor hiring someone with the right qualities that transcend mere familiarity.<p>More than anything we value sound judgement. It&#x27;s great if you have loads of tools in in your tool belt, but you really have to know when it makes sense to use them.<p>As you get involved with research or optimization work, we want to have confidence that you&#x27;ll have the right intuition about what questions to pursue and what questions to defer. With our high transaction volume, hundreds of unique models in production and hundreds of thousands of potential features, discernment is an essential virtue. We&#x27;ll always have 5x more questions and curiosities than we&#x27;ll have time to chase down. We&#x27;re looking for that person whose judgement is guided by experience possesses a knack for uncovering valuable, actionable insights.<p>Within our team I lean strongly toward the engineering side of the spectrum, but I&#x27;d be happy to have a conversation about our work. dlarsen@connexity.com If you&#x27;re more comfortable going the typical HR route, I can probably streamline the first phases of communication.",

At Latchel we use technology to make our internal operations much more efficient, but develop to the level our customers&#x27; users are comfortable with. After only a two months of operation, we&#x27;re more than 3x more efficient than the industry standard for maintenance coordination.

(Growth, amiright?)<p>We&#x27;re a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We&#x27;re bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.<p>The type of problems we&#x27;re tackling involve workflow, product design, data, and computer vision for mortgage documents. For data, it decides everything we do. We won&#x27;t start work on a new feature until we can point to the numbers we hope to move.<p>Snapdocs&#x27; culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We&#x27;re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we&#x27;re looking to expand further.<p>Skills &amp; Requirements<p>* Rails Engineer. 3+ years experience, but more is welcome. Ideally, you&#x27;re a full stack coder. But in reality, you probably lean either towards the front or the back end. That&#x27;s fine, so long as you know (and enjoy) your strengths.<p>* Front-end Engineer. 3+ years experience, but more is welcome. You have a deep understanding of CSS but prefer to use Bootstrap. Experience building reusable components a plus.<p>* Data wrangler. We&#x27;re looking to double our Data team.  AI!  Advanced machine learning!  An ability to read past hype-y buzzwords because we don&#x27;t (yet) do those!  We&#x27;re taking a paper-based, non-standardized dataset and extracting insights to help guide product design and market forecasting.  Stack agnostic, we\u2019re more interested in your creative ideas&#x2F;ability to self-execute than a resume.<p>* Being the 10th member of on a fast-growing technical team. This means helping to form a healthy and happy culture. We strive to be respectful of each other&#x27;s time and point of view. We&#x27;re learning how to do this together. We want to create a place where it&#x27;s OK to fail, and that you know the team has your back the whole way through.<p>* Self-motivated. To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.<p>* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch. It is important in this job to listen to them so that we can build what they need and want.<p>Apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;snapdocs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;snapdocs</a>",

We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.<p>It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re big believers in functional programming; OCaml, a statically typed functional language, is our primary development platform. Jane Street\u2019s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code? Visit Open Source @ Jane Street (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;</a>), where you&#x27;ll find several OCaml libraries that we&#x27;ve released into the wild.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d.
