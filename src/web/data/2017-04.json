What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, over half of all K-12 schools in the US (70,000+ schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

After only a two months of operation, we&#x27;re more than 3x more efficient than the industry standard for maintenance coordination.

Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack. This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle&#x27;s particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It&#x27;s a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.<p>Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.

It&#x27;s great if you have loads of tools in in your tool belt, but you really have to know when it makes sense to use them.<p>As you get involved with research or optimization work, we want to have confidence that you&#x27;ll have the right intuition about what questions to pursue and what questions to defer. With our high transaction volume, hundreds of unique models in production and hundreds of thousands of potential features, discernment is an essential virtue. We&#x27;ll always have 5x more questions and curiosities than we&#x27;ll have time to chase down. We&#x27;re looking for that person whose judgement is guided by experience possesses a knack for uncovering valuable, actionable insights.<p>Within our team I lean strongly toward the engineering side of the spectrum, but I&#x27;d be happy to have a conversation about our work. dlarsen@connexity.com If you&#x27;re more comfortable going the typical HR route, I can probably streamline the first phases of communication.",

An hour later the router suffered a catastrophic failure dumping 500Gbps of traffic onto an already congested alternate path causing ripples across the Internet, disrupting websites and other Internet based services on the U.S Eastern seaboard.\nSocial media is ablaze as frustrated people rant about their favorite website, video, or gaming service being down, or so slow that it\u2019s unusable. While the Internet burns, our customers are humming away oblivious to the disaster.\nIf you have an insatiable curiosity, love the process of discovery, and you\u2019re reading this with a grin... we should talk.\nCome join us and...<p>* Do what nobody else in the world is doing... literally.<p>* Gain knowledge and expertise on the inner workings of the Internet, working with top-tier Network Engineers<p>* Define and Develop Amazon\u2019s Internet Monitoring architecture<p>* Play in the piles of data to discover patterns that push our understanding and knowledge of Internet performance and \navailability anomalies<p>* Build massive real-time systems which inform and drive complex changes across the Internet<p>* Gain practical experience building software using Amazon Web Services<p>We are hiring for SDE&#x2F;SysDE I (Entry Level), SDE&#x2F;SysDE II (Mid-Level), Senior SDE, and Research&#x2F;Data Scientist I&#x2F;II (Entry&#x2F;Mid Level).

A PoC of an early version of the idea was featured here on HN 3 years ago: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8069386</a>. Time has passed since then and the idea, and technologies required for building it, have evolved. It is my belief the time for this idea, from a market-perspective, has arrived.<p>The service will be designed to improve the process of integrating a company&#x27;s API product with channel partners, either on-prem or in a hosted manner, with the intent to increase pass-through revenue on the API calls a company provides, while providing a simple federated layer based on blochchain backed data structures. This idea is in pre-funding, so I&#x27;m explicitly stating anyone interested in my idea should consider their founder-level involvement as purely self-choice driven. Influencing, making or removing choice for you in this regard is illogical and irrational, given the state of the company (non-existent) and funding (also non-existent). However, if you hold the view that the existing methods for securing the Internet&#x27;s infrastructure are woefully inadequate and you feel applying cryptocurrency to APIs could make companies more money by securing them against use by limiting calls with payments, then you should contact me and we should have a conversation about it.<p>Expertise in building scalable API calls with microservices-based architecture is desired, but a more general gift in development is also welcome. I code in Python, Javascript and C++, and am decently good at running infrastructure, given my history. My primary function is strategy, operations and architecture. I do not visualize, so I tend to communicate differently.<p>My email address is in my profile here on HN. Happy to just discuss the idea, if you are interested, as opposed to any expectation of finding someone this early on to join me.<p>If you&#x27;ve read this far, I appreciate you. I will note that this idea can be applied to AI in a less than obvious way. This reason is the primary purpose of the project, but making revenue in other ways first remains important.",

Jane Street\u2019s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code? Visit Open Source @ Jane Street (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;</a>), where you&#x27;ll find several OCaml libraries that we&#x27;ve released into the wild.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We\u2019re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.\nOur engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

There will be partner evaluations to answer, and partner evaluations to perform. You\u2019ll be figuring out how we can use 3rd party services more securely, and how to segment and protect our data internally. These activities won\u2019t take all your time, though. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to pursue other things that help improve Blink\u2019s overall security, and plenty of discretion as to how to go about that. You\u2019ll have a lot of responsibility, but you\u2019ll also always have help and guidance.<p>Maybe you\u2019re a governance &amp; risk management consultant who prefers to hang out with the pen testers.

Maybe you\u2019ve got some other reason that you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s all good, let\u2019s find a way for you to do interesting work and contribute to fixing health care.<p>Why you want to work for Blink Health:<p>* Interesting, varied work<p>* Building a real thing that actually helps people<p>* Get in early on a startup that has hundreds of thousands of paying customers<p>* Healthy work environment (friendly, reasonable people, crunch time is super-rare)<p>* Standard \u201cwell-funded startup\u201d perks (unlimited vacation time (you will actually take vacation), free lunches, great stock plan, etc.)<p>* Standard \u201creal company\u201d benefits (health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental, 401(k), etc.)<p>What you should have to apply:<p>* Practical experience related to policy, governance, risk, and&#x2F;or compliance.
