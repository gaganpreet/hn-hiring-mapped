These tools could be used to map any topic, from historical events, to components of a legal case, to how a combustion engine works, etc. We sometimes think of this as &quot;Google Maps for information&quot;.<p>Come help us work through a bunch of fun&#x2F;hard technical challenges: building interactive data visualizations, facilitating real-time collaboration, large-scale text understanding, searching a distributed knowledge base.<p>Our tech stack includes bespoke JavaScript, SVG, [S]CSS, Riot.js and some off-the-shelf helper libraries for interactive map building and visualization (but in our hearts we&#x27;re framework agnostic); Redis &#x2F; Node.js &#x2F; WebSockets for real-time collaboration; MySQL for a source of truth; and some other tools and services around text-understanding and image processing in Python.<p>We really want to find the right person for this, and will compensate accordingly.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plectica.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plectica.com</a>, and if you&#x27;re interested send us a note at jobs@plectica.com, or email me directly (doug at lastofthe.org)",

That being said, we do have the product up and running with a bunch of active users providing us constant feedback, as well as funding to pay reasonable salaries.<p>At PrompterAI we build a virtual assistant for people working in sales and account management. The information they need to keep up with is scattered around tons of different tools: LinkedIn, news, email, Slack, CRM, support ticketing system, intranet etc. Based on users&#x27; calendar, who they are meeting with and what the meetings are about, we filter and aggregate  relevant information from all those tools and compile it into a daily briefing package. It&#x27;s kind of like a virtual executive assistant that helps people to keep up with everything and making sure no balls get dropped.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, drop me a line at lauri (at) prompter.ai, happy to chat more :)",

Stan emerged from the research group under Andrew Gelman at Columbia, which is focused on state-of-the-art in Bayesian inference methodology and consulted on a variety of statistical problems in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, sports, and business. Since its initial release, we\u2019ve welcomed collaborators and contributors across the globe and have about 30 active contributors at the time of writing.<p>We\u2019re looking for a tools and infrastructure developer who is interested in science and open source, is a self-starter and intrinsically motivated to help out, wants a flexible lifestyle, and would like to learn Bayesian stats and data analysis. Ideally you\u2019d come in knowing a decent amount about either systems administration or programming (or both) and we would teach you about statistics. We\u2019re looking for help with the following problems initially:\n* Streamlining installation for our R and Python interfaces for scientists on Windows and Mac, perhaps creating installers for each platform\n* Maintaining and improving our continuous integration infrastructure (currently Jenkins, Travis, AWS)\n* Bringing the PyStan interface up to feature parity with RStan and improving both of them (Python)\n* Higher order autodiff test framework and infrastructure (C++)<p>We expect that you will need to spend a significant portion of your time on at least some of these problems at first. Beyond that, there is much work to be done on Stan as an ecosystem. For example, we could also use help with the following key underserved areas of the project:\n* Profiling and performance benchmarks and improvements\n* Various refactorings, mostly in C++ \n* Pedagogical materials\n* GPU and distributed computation support<p>There are also many other ways to improve Stan that could use helping hands:\n* Stan 3.0 language and&#x2F;or compiler rewrite\n* CloudStan\n* Graphical modeling language transpiler\n* New algorithm research implementations\n* Anything from the list here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longer-Term-To-Do-List\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longer-Term-To-Do-List</a><p>Links to some Stan team outputs and other Stan-related resources:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev</a>\nandrewgelman.com\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mc-stan.org&#x2F;users&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mc-stan.org&#x2F;users&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stancon_talks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stancon_talks</a>\ngreat intro Bayesian analysis book: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xcelab.net&#x2F;rm&#x2F;statistical-rethinking&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xcelab.net&#x2F;rm&#x2F;statistical-rethinking&#x2F;</a><p>To apply, email Sean Talts, contact info here: mc-stan.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;team&#x2F;",

When each interview is done, you&#x27;re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

We&#x27;re broken into two main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs) and R&amp;D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well.<p>Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&amp;D</i> is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service &amp; Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire &#x2F; Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We&#x27;re adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project and we&#x27;re a platinum CNCF member with rapidly-growing contributions to the k8s ecosystem. There is a lot happening right now and there are greenfield platform opportunities.<p>Not many people get to work on or work with such systems. Why not you?<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>To see open jobs, go to pivotal.io&#x2F;careers.

Scientists are really excited about our technology as evidenced by the company seeing $71 million in revenue in 2017, which was more than double the revenue in 2016. We&#x27;re also looking to double our revenue again in 2018.<p>You can read about (and run if you&#x27;d like) our massively parallel pipelines as well as our visualization software at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;</a>.

Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!<p>Check out our careers page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackshare.io&#x2F;careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile URL!",

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

We grow mostly YC startups.\n  - Clients include: Envoy, Clearbit, and Sentry. Plus a dozen more.\n  - Our team: 6 engineers turned marketers. \n  - Approach: We emphasize data \u2014 not brand voice.
