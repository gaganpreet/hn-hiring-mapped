We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC&#x2F;ppc&#x2F;POWER, MIPS, ARMv8&#x2F;Thumb2&#x2F;AArch64, x86-64&#x2F;x64&#x2F;Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.<p>We don&#x27;t normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We&#x27;re never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.<p>Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.<p>You can email me at users.sf.net, with account name albert.",

Being excited about music is definitely a bonus, but we have loads of fun and exciting programming projects in the pipeline. Ideas are welcome and many of our improvements come from people in the business suggesting them.<p>Our projects are primarily in Ruby and JavaScript, though we also develop IoT applications in languages like Rust and Haskell. We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming.<p>Ideally we&#x27;re looking for people in Bristol, where we&#x27;re soon opening a new office. Many of the dev team work remotely, but the majority of us are within easy distance of Bristol (or London) and we meet up regularly to discuss&#x2F;work&#x2F;beer together.<p>I&#x27;m Head of Development, and working for Pirate Studios is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll go out of my way to make sure you get to build great things :)<p>Email us at tech-jobs@piratestudios.co.uk",

Stan emerged from the research group under Andrew Gelman at Columbia, which is focused on state-of-the-art in Bayesian inference methodology and consulted on a variety of statistical problems in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, sports, and business. Since its initial release, we\u2019ve welcomed collaborators and contributors across the globe and have about 30 active contributors at the time of writing.<p>We\u2019re looking for a tools and infrastructure developer who is interested in science and open source, is a self-starter and intrinsically motivated to help out, wants a flexible lifestyle, and would like to learn Bayesian stats and data analysis. Ideally you\u2019d come in knowing a decent amount about either systems administration or programming (or both) and we would teach you about statistics. We\u2019re looking for help with the following problems initially:\n* Streamlining installation for our R and Python interfaces for scientists on Windows and Mac, perhaps creating installers for each platform\n* Maintaining and improving our continuous integration infrastructure (currently Jenkins, Travis, AWS)\n* Bringing the PyStan interface up to feature parity with RStan and improving both of them (Python)\n* Higher order autodiff test framework and infrastructure (C++)<p>We expect that you will need to spend a significant portion of your time on at least some of these problems at first. Beyond that, there is much work to be done on Stan as an ecosystem. For example, we could also use help with the following key underserved areas of the project:\n* Profiling and performance benchmarks and improvements\n* Various refactorings, mostly in C++ \n* Pedagogical materials\n* GPU and distributed computation support<p>There are also many other ways to improve Stan that could use helping hands:\n* Stan 3.0 language and&#x2F;or compiler rewrite\n* CloudStan\n* Graphical modeling language transpiler\n* New algorithm research implementations\n* Anything from the list here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longer-Term-To-Do-List\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Longer-Term-To-Do-List</a><p>Links to some Stan team outputs and other Stan-related resources:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev</a>\nandrewgelman.com\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mc-stan.org&#x2F;users&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mc-stan.org&#x2F;users&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stancon_talks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stan-dev&#x2F;stancon_talks</a>\ngreat intro Bayesian analysis book: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xcelab.net&#x2F;rm&#x2F;statistical-rethinking&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;xcelab.net&#x2F;rm&#x2F;statistical-rethinking&#x2F;</a><p>To apply, email Sean Talts, contact info here: mc-stan.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;team&#x2F;",

You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog!

Do you really want to know how things work, and share that knowledge with your team and the wider community? Do you understand how people and technology can come together to craft something special, each reshaping the other?<p>Endjin are hiring developers at all levels, from apprentices to seniors, to work on exciting projects with clients from all over the world, in verticals from retail to financial services, utilities and media.<p>We build modern data platforms in the cloud, and use them to help businesses adopt machine learning, data science, and automation.<p>We work with fascinating new technologies like Service Fabric, Reactor, Cosmos DB, and Data Lake to develop novel software architecture at the boundaries of hyperscale computing, for our clients, our own internal IP, and partners like Microsoft.<p>We increase our value by using our products, blueprints and library of intellectual property, sharing the benefit with our clients and partners.<p>We value life-long learning and an eye for quality. We will help you to find the best learning techniques, tools, and team-working, so that you can achieve your potential, and deliver the best value to our clients; while balancing your personal goals and home life.<p>Our employees have a mutual respect, regardless of where they are in their career. Ideas are developed by the whole team, from interns to seniors.<p>Equally, our clients pass the &quot;nice to work for&quot; test (and usually do so with flying colours). As part of that, we try to understand the ethical implications of the work we undertake. We seek to do the best we can for each other, for our profession, clients, and for the world at large.\nWith no external investors, endjin has been built as a sustainable, lifelong business: we are a company to retire out of, not exit at the expense of the employees.<p>You can work remotely from anywhere in the UK, and we hold meet-ups in London on a regular basis. You design your ideal working environment, and we will make it happen together.<p>Apart from a real passion for learning, you probably dream in data - how it can be represented, handled, secured and manipulated. A bit of maths improves your day. You know a couple of programming languages pretty well (we do a lot of C# and Typescript, but you may know R, or Python too). You love working with other people, but value the opportunity to spend time in your own head, thinking things through.<p>You can learn more about our projects at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endjin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endjin.com</a>, see a video about our career development pathways <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;200191869\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;200191869</a> or read our blog <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.endjin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.endjin.com</a><p>Contact us on hello-at-endjin-dot-com if you think this looks like a good opportunity for you.",

We mean it.<p>We value aptitude over alma mater, empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming. We&#x27;re broken into two main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs) and R&amp;D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well.<p>Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&amp;D</i> is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service &amp; Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire &#x2F; Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We&#x27;re adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project and we&#x27;re a platinum CNCF member with rapidly-growing contributions to the k8s ecosystem. There is a lot happening right now and there are greenfield platform opportunities.<p>Not many people get to work on or work with such systems. Why not you?<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
