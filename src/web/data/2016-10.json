Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products.

This is a great opportunity to work with very smart people in very challenging problems (I actually mean this, I am a software engineer who just started last November and I am astonished at the projects I have been able to work on so far and the technologies I have used). We are a new team, the oldest member has been here a bit over a year, and we are trying to find the best software engineers to grow our team even more. We need them as the scale of the problems we are trying to solve is huge and we put a lot of focus on creating elegant solutions for those problems. One big plus also is that we encourage continuous learning (we have workshops and tech talks often) and we love it when you contribute (or have contributed) to an open source project. We want to give back to the community in different ways too (we volunteer, and do meetups frequently). So if you are super smart, like to be surrounded by smart people and solve difficult distributed problems, and you want to help define and build our office culture, you should contact us!\nJust a note. For Junior devs, fresh out of school, we don&#x27;t care what language you code in (even though we use Java here for the most part so at least you should be willing to learn it).

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, almost half of all schools in the US (64,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

We use our own product every day to promote and encourage our culture of openness and transparency. Yammer provides each user with a voice, empowering individuals to share ideas, ask questions, and voice concerns.

Our Frontend engineering team works on a rich, complex client-side application. And at Yammer, engineers don&#x27;t just get handed specs and mocks to build -- we work in an iterative and collaborative way with Product and Design to create the best possible user experience.   So, we need people who are enthusiastic, who ask great questions, who have strong opinions but aren&#x27;t afraid to admit when they&#x27;re wrong, and who enjoy collaborating with a cross-functional team. At Yammer we hire smart people, expect them to learn and grow, and trust them to make day-to-day decisions. We care most about creating products people love - to enable that, we move quickly (pushing code to production at least daily), we iterate, and we value learning over shipping features.<p>keywords:- React, JS, JavaScript, HTML, Backbone, ES6, Redux, TypeScript",

We will suggest to sales professionals the actions they need to take next to close deals. They&#x27;ll instead need to monitor our &quot;autopilot&quot; system and manually override only when needed. Unlike most AI startups, we can actually build this - we have 100M+ datapoints of sales professionals manually closing deals to make the training actually possible.<p>Email Graphs<p>We&#x27;re building systems to better understand how organizations communicate with one another. Email is currently siloed into individual user inboxes, we&#x27;re building a graph database containing every email message in our users&#x27; inboxes to give them insights into how their company communicates with their customers.<p>Reverse Engineer Gmail<p>We strive for deep integration with Gmail, because that&#x27;s where our users live. Our integration has to be seamless, deep, performant, resilient and secure. It&#x27;s such a hard problem, even our competitors use our tech (InboxSDK). We&#x27;re doing it next for Inbox, Calendar, and more.<p>Outside of the hard problems you&#x27;ll also have a very large impact, not just on our organization but on our customers. We have the best of both worlds: we&#x27;re small (6 eng) so no meetings and other big company BS, but are profitable (millions in revenue) with a wide variety of customers that use Streak everyday for hours at a time.<p>Tech Stack:<p>Backend is 80% Java and 20% Go (and growing) on Google App Engine (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudplatform.googleblog.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;Streaks-Top-6-T...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudplatform.googleblog.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;Streaks-Top-6-T...</a>) and Compute Engine.

While it\u2019s clear that the future of retail will rely heavily on new technologies and the internet, we are still discovering how this will pair with in-store shopping to power commerce in the coming years and decades. With millions of customers, both online and offline, HBC Digital is positioned at the center of this reinvention.<p>OUR CULTURE<p>A recent survey of HBC Digital employees about our culture revealed the three most common responses were fast-paced, team-oriented and growth.<p>Fast-paced \u2013 Our employees are constantly tackling new problems and challenges that result from working at a company growing rapidly through acquisitions and in an industry that is continuously evolving.<p>Team-oriented \u2013 Our employees work on small, cross-functional teams with a high level of autonomy and ownership.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>Presently we&#x27;re hiring engineers in Atlanta, Beaverton, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Dublin, London, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, Sydney, Toronto and Washington DC.

We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well.  We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both Senior Engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as Junior Engineers who are just getting started. We\u2019re looking for Junior Engineers who are eager to learn, who thrive on great mentorship, and who want to work on a mission that makes a difference.

We&#x27;re bringing a leap in higher-order clarity and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. The scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data means that this is an area with no shortage of hard problems, where engineering still matters and can yield big payoffs.

Ardusat is a growing educational technology company providing engaging experiences to science and math students by creating technology, products, and curriculum preparing them to run custom experiments on real satellites in space. With over $6B available in public and private STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) grants, this is an exciting space to work in. We are a small (9 person) team with a successful round of seed funding and a lot of really promising district pilot programs. Everyone at Ardusat is here because we believe parts of the education system are broken, and need to be fixed. We want our work to impact students\u2019 lives all over the world by cultivating more interest in math, science, and technology.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced engineer to work on building out our student&#x2F;teacher software features and help us scale as we grow. We&#x27;ve got a great working platform that is used by schools around the world to conduct science experiments, create and discover curriculum, and help manage, document, and assess Maker projects in the classroom. We have tons of ideas, but we need help taking this tool set to the next level. As an Ardusat software engineer, you would be responsible for architecting major new features and portions of our system - we&#x27;re not just ticking off a bug list here. The ideal candidate is someone who has experience building web applications from the ground up and is excited by owning a large portion of product direction and design decisions.<p>Development Process:\nOur development process is organized around 2-3 week sprints, and we have 2 in-person engineering tag ups a week. We are a small team and encourage autonomy, so we do asynchronous daily updates (accomplishments, blockers, collaboration needs) but try to avoid getting too bogged down in process or unnecessary meetings. We value accomplishments, not time-in-office, so we try to optimize our process around allowing flexibility and personal accountability.<p>Tech Stack:\nOur website and API are powered by Ruby on Rails, our experiment tools and platform use Angular.js, our real-time features use Node.js, and we have a handful of microservices related to our data pipeline using Python. On the database side, we use Redis to coordinate services and Postgres for our primary data store. We\u2019re especially interested in candidates with Ruby, Javascript, and Angular experience, but for the right candidate we\u2019re open to other languages&#x2F;platform experience with a demonstrated track record for learning new technology. Although everyone wears a lot of hats at an early startup like Ardusat, this position will be more backend focused, so experience with server management, cloud platforms (we use AWS), Docker, CI, or API design is a plus (although not required). Experience with &quot;maker&quot; technologies including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, etc. is also a plus.<p>Apply or request more details: jobs@ardusat.com\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs</a> for more details.",

NYGC&#x27;s partnerships with nearby top-tier hospitals in Manhattan enable unique human analysis studies. We have both junior and senior software engineering positions available. The group is a mixed local&#x2F;remote team, but all of the currently open positions are ONSITE. Our interview process is phone conversation followed by onsite interview.<p>NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We have gone from zero to top-three in five years, and we are hungry to become the leader. We&#x27;re aggressively scaling our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.<p>These positions are for the automation group, which currently has ten people. NYGC is graduating from successful startup to a medium-sized company. In software, we&#x27;re replacing duct tape with small applications, and introducing larger applications to help people with scale. We also introduce duct tape to make impossible things happen. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don&#x27;t have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool&#x27;s use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.<p>This group uses python and postgresql, adding minimal javascript when making frontend applications. We are intentionally boring (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valdhaus.co&#x2F;writings&#x2F;boring-systems&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valdhaus.co&#x2F;writings&#x2F;boring-systems&#x2F;</a>) in our technology choices because our goal is data analysis, not novel software work. We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, the data transport team (surprisingly fun at &gt;20PB), the customer delivery team, the JIRA team. We don&#x27;t do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. Our team is not Agile, but our business is. We make it all run at scale, on our local cluster of &gt;6k cores. This group is focused on making a sequencing lab and automated analyses run at scale.<p>The lab and automation combined drive some really interesting real-world problems, particularly in the clinical space. How fast can we get first-order cancer screening to sick people? If you want to be part of a growing firm that drives science with stable software solutions, please drop me a note or use NYGC&#x27;s careers page.",

The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware.

We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had.

It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life.
