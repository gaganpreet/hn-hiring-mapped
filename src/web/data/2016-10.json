Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below).

We&#x27;re bringing a leap in higher-order clarity and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. The scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data means that this is an area with no shortage of hard problems, where engineering still matters and can yield big payoffs. Our software and instruments are used at top research institutions and hospitals around the world. 10x Genomics has most recently raised a $55M Series C from Fidelity and SoftBank and has about 120 employees in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and in the field across the world.<p>You can view a demo of our existing software at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;</a>, or read about our pipelines at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com</a>.

NYGC&#x27;s partnerships with nearby top-tier hospitals in Manhattan enable unique human analysis studies. We have both junior and senior software engineering positions available. The group is a mixed local&#x2F;remote team, but all of the currently open positions are ONSITE. Our interview process is phone conversation followed by onsite interview.<p>NYGC is not a software company; it is a sequencing lab trying to push science at scale, and needs software to do so. We have gone from zero to top-three in five years, and we are hungry to become the leader. We&#x27;re aggressively scaling our clinical services, so if you have even the smallest allergy to documentation or process, please stop reading now.<p>These positions are for the automation group, which currently has ten people. NYGC is graduating from successful startup to a medium-sized company. In software, we&#x27;re replacing duct tape with small applications, and introducing larger applications to help people with scale. We also introduce duct tape to make impossible things happen. People who join NYGC software are expected to learn quickly, be self-motivated, and be comfortable switching tracks. You don&#x27;t have to understand e.g. genome sequence alignment, but you do have to be able to read a manual on a tool&#x27;s use and learn enough vocabulary to have an intelligent conversation with an expert on the subject.<p>This group uses python and postgresql, adding minimal javascript when making frontend applications.

We design everything for reliability, maintenance, low cost of ownership, and failure recovery. It is a combination of boring technology and fast pace: we are the computational pipeline team, the automation team, the LIMS team, the database team, the data transport team (surprisingly fun at &gt;20PB), the customer delivery team, the JIRA team. We don&#x27;t do genomic methods software (e.g. better variant calling) -- we have a great computational biology group for that. Our team is not Agile, but our business is. We make it all run at scale, on our local cluster of &gt;6k cores. This group is focused on making a sequencing lab and automated analyses run at scale.<p>The lab and automation combined drive some really interesting real-world problems, particularly in the clinical space. How fast can we get first-order cancer screening to sick people?

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>Presently we&#x27;re hiring engineers in Atlanta, Beaverton, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Dublin, London, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, Sydney, Toronto and Washington DC.

Ardusat is a growing educational technology company providing engaging experiences to science and math students by creating technology, products, and curriculum preparing them to run custom experiments on real satellites in space. With over $6B available in public and private STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) grants, this is an exciting space to work in. We are a small (9 person) team with a successful round of seed funding and a lot of really promising district pilot programs. Everyone at Ardusat is here because we believe parts of the education system are broken, and need to be fixed. We want our work to impact students\u2019 lives all over the world by cultivating more interest in math, science, and technology.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an experienced engineer to work on building out our student&#x2F;teacher software features and help us scale as we grow. We&#x27;ve got a great working platform that is used by schools around the world to conduct science experiments, create and discover curriculum, and help manage, document, and assess Maker projects in the classroom. We have tons of ideas, but we need help taking this tool set to the next level. As an Ardusat software engineer, you would be responsible for architecting major new features and portions of our system - we&#x27;re not just ticking off a bug list here. The ideal candidate is someone who has experience building web applications from the ground up and is excited by owning a large portion of product direction and design decisions.<p>Development Process:\nOur development process is organized around 2-3 week sprints, and we have 2 in-person engineering tag ups a week. We are a small team and encourage autonomy, so we do asynchronous daily updates (accomplishments, blockers, collaboration needs) but try to avoid getting too bogged down in process or unnecessary meetings. We value accomplishments, not time-in-office, so we try to optimize our process around allowing flexibility and personal accountability.<p>Tech Stack:\nOur website and API are powered by Ruby on Rails, our experiment tools and platform use Angular.js, our real-time features use Node.js, and we have a handful of microservices related to our data pipeline using Python. On the database side, we use Redis to coordinate services and Postgres for our primary data store. We\u2019re especially interested in candidates with Ruby, Javascript, and Angular experience, but for the right candidate we\u2019re open to other languages&#x2F;platform experience with a demonstrated track record for learning new technology. Although everyone wears a lot of hats at an early startup like Ardusat, this position will be more backend focused, so experience with server management, cloud platforms (we use AWS), Docker, CI, or API design is a plus (although not required). Experience with &quot;maker&quot; technologies including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, etc. is also a plus.<p>Apply or request more details: jobs@ardusat.com\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ardusat.com&#x2F;jobs</a> for more details.",

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.
