We're a small, 50-person non-profit tech startup making a big difference in the world. Here's a testimonial we received just last night:</p><p><i>December 31, 2013</i></p><p><i>I have recently turned thirteen, and accompanied by your proficient and efficient teaching style, I have successfully advanced into multi-variable calculus. When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green's Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface. Hopefully I will be taking the AP Calculus examinations soon!</i></p><p><i>Thank you for everything!</i></p><p>How cool is that? Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We're working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we've totally transformed.</p><p>We're starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that's guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please reach out</i>. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.</p><p>Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of interactive exercises. Our 100,000+ math problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.</p><p>With this scale, we're able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement. (We're also beginning to release anonymized data to interested researchers.)</p><p>Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business \u2013 though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.</p><p>We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too.</p><p>---</p><p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us and we're doing everything we can to find great mobile devs.</p><p>We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.</p><p>Please apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!), but if you have questions, feel free to ask here or to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org.</p><p>Thanks for reading; have a great 2014!</p><p>[1]: <a href=\"http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a></p><p>[3]: <a href=\"http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/</a> (sorry about the background, but there are dinosaur pictures!)</p><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we-give-dev-interns\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we...</a></p><p>[5]: <a href=\"http://life.khanacademy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://life.khanacademy.org/</a></p></font>",

Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.</p><p>The two main technical challenges we face are:</p><p>* Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.</p><p>* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)</p><p>Our technology stack:</p><p>* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported</p><p>* Elasticsearch for... search</p><p>* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)</p><p>* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)</p><p>Things we like:</p><p>* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)</p><p>* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.</p><p>* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary.</p><p>What we're looking for:</p><p>We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we're now working towards a product covering public data for the UK.</p><p>We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for \u00a31,000 a month + stock option plan.

If reimagining this world sounds interesting, come talk to us \u2013\u00a0we've got a product in market, just closed a 2.1M seed round, and are hiring engineer #1.</p><p>Our stack is Rails + AngularJS. We've been using AngularJS since day 1 and love it (and have paid it forward in some pull requests). Our development workflow is simple and robust \u2013\u00a0Trello for task management, CircleCI for continuous integration, and deployment to Heroku.</p><p>The product is a collaboration and workflow platform for CRE leasing teams. Our goals are to dramatically increase their operational efficiency with a purpose built web + mobile experience, and to leverage the underlying data to deliver performance insights to insititutional owners.</p><p>Hightower is being actively piloted by some of the biggest names in CRE, and we've raised a 2.1M seed round led by BVP and Thrive Capital with participation from a host of amazing angels and VC including Aaron Levie, Lee Linden, David Tisch and Gary Vaynerhuck. Our founding team is Brandon Weber (CEO \u2013\u00a0CMU graduate and former VP @ CBRE), Niall Smart (CTO, formerly founder of YC W09 company Echodio, which sold to RealNetworks) and Donald DeSantis (CDO, formerly founder of LIFFFT, early Redfin employee).</p><p>We're hiring engineer #1. Knowledge of CRE is not a pre-requisite.

Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.\nI would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.</p><p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.</p><p>Here is what you get.\nMoney\nFreedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)\nReal World Education\nAbility to become a killer coder\nand whatever else. i'm pretty flexible</p><p>Languages?\nPython/Ruby Obj-C Javascript\nYou name it.\nIf you can show competency in some language I currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.</p><p>About me, your 'boss'.\nLate 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the 'valley'. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.</p><p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.\nI have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.</p><p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.</p><p>Long story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.</p><p>You'll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).</p><p>We'll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.</p><p>email hn0114@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.</p></font>",

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.</p><p>One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files and other data on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently finishing up a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.</p><p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.</p><p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested! I'm in Boston all January and will be at the Real World Crypto conference in NYC, so if you're in one of those cities and want to say hello, I'd be glad to chat.</p></font>",

However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.</p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.</p><p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.</p></font>",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know <i>you</i> are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at we.are.expensify.com/apply).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
