        "full_html": "<font color=\"#000000\">Hi all,<p>As you're planning your New Year's resolutions, consider: if you could work anywhere, what would you do?</p><p>- Wouldn't you want to work towards <i>really</i> making the world a better place?</p><p>- Wouldn't you want to work with a top-notch team alongside some of the brightest engineers in the industry?</p><p>- Wouldn't you want to work on solving interesting problems that haven't been solved before?</p><p>---</p><p>At Khan Academy, I truly believe that you can find all of those things and more. We're a small, 50-person non-profit tech startup making a big difference in the world. Here's a testimonial we received just last night:</p><p><i>December 31, 2013</i></p><p><i>I have recently turned thirteen, and accompanied by your proficient and efficient teaching style, I have successfully advanced into multi-variable calculus. When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green's Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface. Hopefully I will be taking the AP Calculus examinations soon!</i></p><p><i>Thank you for everything!</i></p><p>How cool is that? Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We're working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we've totally transformed.</p><p>We're starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that's guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please reach out</i>. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.</p><p>Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of interactive exercises. Our 100,000+ math problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.</p><p>With this scale, we're able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement. (We're also beginning to release anonymized data to interested researchers.)</p><p>Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business \u2013 though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.</p><p>We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too.</p><p>---</p><p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us and we're doing everything we can to find great mobile devs.</p><p>We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.</p><p>Please apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!), but if you have questions, feel free to ask here or to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org.</p><p>Thanks for reading; have a great 2014!</p><p>[1]: <a href=\"http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a></p><p>[3]: <a href=\"http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/</a> (sorry about the background, but there are dinosaur pictures!)</p><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we-give-dev-interns\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we...</a></p><p>[5]: <a href=\"http://life.khanacademy.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://life.khanacademy.org/</a></p></font>",

Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.</p><p>We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>We're a small startup (you'd be #10), but well funded and have customers.

Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it's businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.</p><p>The two main technical challenges we face are:</p><p>* Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.</p><p>* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they're looking for, and then making that UI fast (we're currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)</p><p>Our technology stack:</p><p>* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we've imported</p><p>* Elasticsearch for... search</p><p>* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)</p><p>* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)</p><p>Things we like:</p><p>* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it's better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)</p><p>* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they're ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.</p><p>* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary.</p><p>What we're looking for:</p><p>We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we're now working towards a product covering public data for the UK.</p><p>We're looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for \u00a31,000 a month + stock option plan.

Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why you\u2019re interested:<p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com</p></font>",

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.</p><p>One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files and other data on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently finishing up a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.</p><p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.</p><p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested! I'm in Boston all January and will be at the Real World Crypto conference in NYC, so if you're in one of those cities and want to say hello, I'd be glad to chat.</p></font>",

One of you is perfect for this idea.</p><p>I am a serial entrepreneur who is currently trapped in the body of a freelance contractor. I have a relatively stable 40 hour a week project, and incoming projects as well that I generally can't take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)</p><p>So here's the idea.\nYou. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.\nI would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.</p><p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.</p><p>Here is what you get.\nMoney\nFreedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)\nReal World Education\nAbility to become a killer coder\nand whatever else. i'm pretty flexible</p><p>Languages?\nPython/Ruby Obj-C Javascript\nYou name it.\nIf you can show competency in some language I currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.</p><p>About me, your 'boss'.\nLate 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the 'valley'. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.</p><p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.\nI have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.</p><p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.</p><p>Long story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.</p><p>You'll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).</p><p>We'll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.</p><p>email hn0114@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.</p></font>",

A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.</p><p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.</p><p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, discovering clean energy amongst other things.</p><p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.\" Over 6 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 600k plus join up each month.</p><p>If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.</p><p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

Not only are we a startup (the team went through Excelerate 2011, which is now Techstars Chicago) but we are working on a real problem that should help companies meet the rising consumer demand for healthier food options. What I love about posting this job on HN is it is a community of people who get excited about this kind of thing :)</p><p>You will be our first engineering hire (outside of myself) and will contribute to the website, the data collection tool, subscription reports and our auction platform. All are currently Rails, with a live trading platform under development that is Erlang/Elixir. The front end relies on jQuery and some graphing libraries. The code is ripe for some refactoring (don't worry, it isn't awful, but we pursued a few directions that we did not end up going in). You will have a large degree of flexibility to add functionality, clean things up, upgrade libraries, etc. with the strong caveat that you must write tests to make sure that you don't break anything and that you test browser compatibility. Ideally you should have enough experience to be able to contribute immediately but not so much as to be bored. Some other potentially interesting projects that will need to be tackled include a more robust testing suite and continuous integration.</p><p>I work out of a combination of 1871 and from home, so schedule will be flexible. I like to provide a fair degree of autonomy, but that only works with a large degree of communication. We use Asana to track tasks and email/phone/in person meetings to ask questions, discuss features, etc.</p><p>Salary will be dependent on experience. Options, 401k and health insurance are also part of the compensation package.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, please send me a note to chris at mercariscompany.com and let's talk.

We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.</p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.</p><p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.</p></font>",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know <i>you</i> are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at we.are.expensify.com/apply).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
