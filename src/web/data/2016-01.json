We&#x27;re bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.<p>The type of problems we&#x27;re tackling involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.<p>Snapdocs\u2019 culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We&#x27;re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we&#x27;re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>==Job Description and Required Skills== * Rails Engineer. 3+ years experience, but more is welcome. Ideally, you&#x27;re a full stack coder. But in reality, you probably lean either towards the front or the back end. That&#x27;s fine, so long as you know (and are proud of) your strengths.<p>* Being the 5th member of on a fast-growing technical team. This means helping to form a healthy and happy culture. We strive to be respectful of each other&#x27;s time and point of view. We&#x27;re learning how to do this together. We want to create a place where it&#x27;s OK to fail, and that you know the team has your back the whole way through.<p>* Self-motivated. To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.<p>* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch. It is important in this job to listen to them so that we can build what they need and want.<p>* Knowledge of AWS would be excellent.<p>* UX experience (or interest in cultivating it) would be excellent.<p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself.

We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance.
