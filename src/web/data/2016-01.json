Sometimes remote work tools are (nearly) flawless, but with some bad luck you might be explaining something complicated over a choppy connection with a 4-second delay and a marching band in the background.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in PKB&#x27;s growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. Or Google us. I&#x27;m in the CTO role.<p>Current positions we&#x27;re filling (continuously):<p>- Mobile developer: existing apps with Steroids(better Cordova, basically), OAuth2, JSON, REST. Later this year: helping choose tech for our next-gen apps.<p>- Mid-level to senior full-stack devs: Java expertise required. Of interest &#x2F; stuff we&#x27;re using: migrating bit by bit from J2E (JBoss&#x2F;Hibernate, Tomcat&#x2F;Spring&#x2F;Struts) to simple microservices (DropWizard&#x2F;SpringBoot) -- experience on either side of this migration is useful. TeamCity, Artifactory, Docker, Vagrant (dev environment), Selenium-based integration testing. CentOS, PostgreSQL (should be comfortable with native SQL), Hadoop DFS (just adding in now...). Crypto at various levels (&quot;using it carefully&quot;, not &quot;inventing it&quot;). REST and SOAP&#x2F;HL7 APIs. This isn&#x27;t a checklist; we like partial overlaps in particular if you&#x27;ve worked with tools&#x2F;ideas we&#x27;re not yet using (but maybe should).<p>- Product manager: technical background (not just mgmt), startup mindset (look ahead, self-prioritize, adapt fast). Gather the best ideas from customers &amp; us, and help us guide projects through to completion. Bonus points: good grasp of healthcare and mobile apps.<p>Bonus points (all positions) for significant experience in the medical world (as an intelligent patient counts!), as well as some history building things from scratch.<p>More details (and to submit an application): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patientsknowbest.com&#x2F;careers.html</a><p>Note that at present my record for active communication with people applying isn&#x27;t great. :|  We&#x27;ve recently switched to Workable and I&#x27;m sharing out this work so it&#x27;s not purely reliant on bits of time I can claw out of an over-full schedule!

We&#x27;re going to use Python to build a modern infrastructure for interacting with both consumers (via the web, mobile apps and smart-meters) and the industry (eg trading on the wholesale market, managing the billing life cycle).<p>To start with, we&#x27;ll be using Django and the Django-REST-framework for the consumer-facing sites, and employing Pandas and Numpy for some of the heavier data processing required. We use AWS heavily, employing most of the Hashicorp toolset (Vagrant, Packer, Consul, Terraform) and are planning to use Lambda to build event-driven functionality.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is very complicated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular.  The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is genuinely helping to make the world a better place. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon future.<p>More details here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;tech-jobs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;tech-jobs.html</a><p>Our offices are in Hammersmith.

The ideal candidate is someone who plans to become a lead engineer (or perhaps a product manager) in the not too distant future.<p>We&#x27;re a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We&#x27;re bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.<p>The type of problems we&#x27;re tackling involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservice is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.<p>Snapdocs\u2019 culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We&#x27;re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we&#x27;re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>==Job Description and Required Skills== * Rails Engineer. 3+ years experience, but more is welcome. Ideally, you&#x27;re a full stack coder. But in reality, you probably lean either towards the front or the back end. That&#x27;s fine, so long as you know (and are proud of) your strengths.<p>* Being the 5th member of on a fast-growing technical team. This means helping to form a healthy and happy culture. We strive to be respectful of each other&#x27;s time and point of view. We&#x27;re learning how to do this together. We want to create a place where it&#x27;s OK to fail, and that you know the team has your back the whole way through.<p>* Self-motivated. To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.<p>* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch. It is important in this job to listen to them so that we can build what they need and want.<p>* Knowledge of AWS would be excellent.<p>* UX experience (or interest in cultivating it) would be excellent.<p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself.

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.
