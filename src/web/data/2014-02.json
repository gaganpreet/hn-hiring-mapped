We're trying hard to do good for the world. Here's a testimonial we received just two days ago:</p><p><i>January 29, 2014</i></p><p><i>I am an adult returning to school for a midlife career change. I have always disliked math and thought I was bad at it -- and my last math class was over 20 years ago! But I just passed my Accuplacer placement test, thanks to Khan Academy. Thank you so much for making it fun and easy to refresh my skills. I also purchased the Accuplacer test prep app, but I found myself coming back to Khan Academy more often because I liked it more. Now I am learning coding at school, so I'll definitely be back for more!</i></p><p><i>Lisa</i></p><p>This letter is one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives like this that we've transformed.</p><p>--</p><p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done <i>every week</i> on our site. That's a lot.</p><p>With this huge scale, we're able to study learning in a way that wasn't previously possible. We've run tests and found that students learn more when they're given harder problems based on an intelligent machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how different spaced repetition algorithms affect retention. We're also beginning to release anonymized student data to external researchers.</p><p>We're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs so far. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now, you can be a main developer on an app that is <i>guaranteed</i> to have millions of users. This is a rare opportunity.</p><p>You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are also amazing.</p><p>Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring our interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too. I'm also proud to say that we're winning against GitHub in team Bensity (i.e., percentage of employees named Ben) [6].</p><p>---</p><p>We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), designers, and more -- if you're a designer, you might also be interested in our parnership with Bridge [7]. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.</p><p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us. Let me know if you know someone great.</p><p>Please apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!).

A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.</p><p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.</p><p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.</p><p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.\" Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.</p><p>If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.</p><p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

We are now looking for a business co-founder and leader to unlock this potential.</p><p>We\u2019re looking for someone who knows the relevant entertainment markets (including both traditional at-home game consoles and the out-of-home entertainment market); is skilled at business and strategic planning; has experience getting integrated hardware/software products to wide distribution; can get us the right industry partners; can lead fundraising as needed; has executive management potential; and is generally a excellent person who is fun and inspiring to work with.</p><p>Our game table is being featured this month at IndieCade East, the annual independent games festival, at New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image. We think it\u2019s both gorgeous and ergonomically unique, comfortably sitting up to 6 players with plenty of leg room. (Design has been led by a cutting-edge architecture firm headed by MIT/Harvard architecture professors.) Technically, it\u2019s a smart combination of open-source and proprietary software, including our own game framework built on Unity3D. (The core table engineering was led by an MIT Media Lab expert in multi-touch tables.) Unlike many interactive tables, it\u2019s cool and smooth to the touch and is seamless and spill-proof; having a cocktail or beer at the table is encouraged by design. We already have around a dozen games working on the table -- ranging in stage from alpha to polished, some our own, some from third-parties indie game developers.</p><p>In short, we think we\u2019ve created a special product that enables a unique and wonderful face-to-face game experience -- bringing the best of digital technology into a fully present, truly social interaction. Now we\u2019re looking for a co-founder to turn an exceptional product into an exceptional business.</p><p>Additional background: the founder and creative director of Grasshopper NYC is an MIT engineer with a track record of product and business innovation in new media, including high-level executive positions in business news and as as a product management director at Google. A blog post in Gamasutra, a leading games industry website, noted that Grasshopper NYC is being talked about as \u201cthe coolest thing happening in the New York game industry at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Interested?

As founders together have almost 30 years of combined tech and business experience with a few startups and exits already under our belt.</p><p>Your responsibility will be to build the front end app of our analytics platform using Rails and AngularJS. \nThe backend system (data ingestion and analysis) is built on Scala, so there's a chance for you to learn it if you want :)</p><p>This is a fully remote position. You'll be able to work from (almost) anywhere you want and organize you working hours as long as you deliver stuff and bring the product closer to the vision that we\u2019re going to shape together.</p><p>You'll not be told what to do. We'll, instead discuss together what needs to happen then you'll decide what and how to do to make it happen. You'll need to be comfortable with the uncertainty that characterizes the early stage of a startup.</p><p>We value honesty, transparency and direct communication.</p><p>If you're interested to discuss more, tell me your story and show me what you built at fferoldi - at - measurence.com</p><p>To learn more about the founding team:\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/feroldi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/feroldi</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cloudify\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cloudify</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elionarciso\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/elionarciso</a></p></font>",

We forecast at this level as real estate truly is local, and we\u2019ve found there are huge differences in how markets move between zip codes in a county.  Our forecasts have over 90% accuracy forecasting housing prices up to 3 years out for most US real estate markets.  We have back-tested these models for accuracy over the past 40 years, so that we can have confidence in calling the major market turns, and also understand where we are in the cycle and the likely future returns.</p><p>We are currently working with sophisticated institutions such as homebuilders, land investors, mortgage banks, etc. to use these forecasts.</p><p>We will be building housecanary.com into a full consumer oriented website in early 2014.  We want to provide property owners in the US with a simple and accurate forecast for what is likely to happen to their home's value over the next few years (at a zip code level), given that a home represents most people's single largest investment in life. There are many people who want to better understand and plan for future price swings, similar to how they manage the rest of their financial assets, however currently, there is insufficient information available to consumers.  We can now provide 80M US households with powerful data/forecasts only the largest banks and hedge funds had access to historically.</p><p>Positions available:</p><p>UI/UX Designer - Our ideal designer will be able to build beautiful and simple web sites, help out with product design and implement the designs in HTML and CSS.  However being able to code is not required, just a huge plus.  We\u2019re building very data driven products, so experience working on analytic heavy sites is also a plus.</p><p>Frontend developer - Our frontend is compiled statically (hosted on s3 and cloudfront) and all data is pulled via angular from our API.  Our graphs are built using d3.js, we use SASS as our css preprocessor and grunt for our builds and deployment.  Our ideal frontend developer will have prior experience with angular and prior experience building out analytic driven sites</p><p>We\u2019re a small but growing team, so your work will have large impact of the future success of the company.  And as one of our first hires you will rewarded with meaningful equity in the company.</p><p>We have an office in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. We cover health, dental and vision for all of our employees.  Please note, we\u2019re currently only looking to hire people who are located in the US or have US work authorization.</p><p>If interested please email joey@housecanary.com</p></font>",

After downloading it I can say that my first impression is shocked. Shocked that I really liked it.\"</p><p>- \"This is very well done. This could crush Facebook. Not in the short term but if you create a timeline that is more personally valuable to people they will be far more likely to use it and share it with friends and family. Your timeline is already far more interesting then my \"Wall.\"</p><p>- \"Why is it free? I would've paid for this.\"</p><p>- \"I have been looking for this. I've been so desperate for this I've been contemplating creating it myself.\"</p><p>We're looking for mobile engineers (iOS - hard problems include making our sync engine fast/reliable, fast/intuitive search for memories, surfacing important memories in the background, UI performance, and doing it all without using a lot of battery), systems engineers (Python, Devops, Puppet/Chef - hard problems include delivering accurate geocoding for memories, reliable syncing, and building systems to monitor and scale all of it automatically), and data scientists (R/Matlab/SPSS, Python, SQL, statistics, machine learning - hard problems include using ML to improve accuracy of geocoding, building growth and retention models, all while guaranteeing user anonymity and privacy).</p><p>We will fly you out for interviews and relocate you to San Francisco if you aren't here already. A lot of our team work remotely from time to time, but we haven't found full time remote employees to work out well for us since we collaborate so closely together in real time.</p><p>Please email me directly at siqi at hey dot co (8 hour SLA for a response).

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"https://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).\nWe are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
