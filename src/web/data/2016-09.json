The UK energy market is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult <i>technical</i> problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate change. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources.

Our product is a learning management system (LMS), which allows our clients to educate their users. It was recently ranked #4 in Fortune&#x27;s most flexible workplaces[1], and I have the pleasure of saying that this is the best company I have worked at thus far due to the combination of excellent management&#x2F;executives, and tremendous work-life balance enjoyed by all, as well as ample opportunity to move technology forward. In addition, we have better gender balance at the company than most in the area, including in engineering - we strive to be inclusive, although primarily we just want people who are awesome to work with, including being considerate to others.<p>We have a smart &amp; burgeoning engineering group that is working on some interesting problems. Our tech stack includes Node.js (v4), Angular 1 &amp; 2, MySQL, Elasticsearch, &amp; Jenkins, as well as Selenium with Java 8 on the QA automation side. There is a lot of opportunity across the stack to touch many different areas to make improvements. We are open to trying different technologies as well, and have a culture of writing tests for our code. We strike a great balance of keeping product quality high while creating the ability to address technical debt, and get raving reviews from our clients for ease of use.<p>We are willing to relocate able candidates, or allow working remote if the candidate is willing to work roughly standard Pacific time working hours (9 am - 5 pm PT).<p>Our interview process generally involves no whiteboarding or live coding, and instead focuses on experience &amp; ability to design software while working on a team.<p>Please contact me at wesley.cho(at)mindflash.com if interested in more details - no recruiters please, I will not respond.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;best-workplaces-flexibility&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;best-workplaces-flexibility&#x2F;</a>",

Our iOS work is every bit as extensive and challenging as the backend one, if not more.<p>We pursue extreme flexibility, and this requires everyone to be able to morph and adapt to new roles as needed. Hence, you may be exposed to a number of other areas, such as App Store and data analysis, UX and UI design, and several more. We\u2019ll teach you what you don\u2019t know, as long as you\u2019re eager to learn it.<p>More information and application form at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bendingspoons.com&#x2F;careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bendingspoons.com&#x2F;careers.html</a> (Please mention that you found out about us on HN in your cover letter.)",

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 60,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, we\u2019re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out our newest product release here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several senior engineering positions (android, frontend, infra) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products.

Unlike most AI startups, we can actually build this - we have 100M+ datapoints of sales professionals manually closing deals to make the training actually possible.<p>Email Graphs<p>We&#x27;re building systems to better understand how organizations communicate with one another. Email is currently siloed into individual user inboxes, we&#x27;re building a graph database containing every email message in our users&#x27; inboxes to give them insights into how their company communicates with their customers.<p>Reverse Engineer Gmail<p>We strive for deep integration with Gmail, because that&#x27;s where our users live. Our integration has to be seamless, deep, performant, resilient and secure. It&#x27;s such a hard problem, even our competitors use our tech (InboxSDK). We&#x27;re doing it next for Inbox, Calendar, and more.<p>Outside of the hard problems you&#x27;ll also have a very large impact, not just on our organization but on our customers. We have the best of both worlds: we&#x27;re small (6 eng) so no meetings and other big company BS, but are profitable (millions in revenue) with a wide variety of customers that use Streak everyday for hours at a time.<p>Tech Stack:<p>Backend is 95% Java and 5% Go (and growing) on Google App Engine (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudplatform.googleblog.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;Streaks-Top-6-T...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudplatform.googleblog.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;Streaks-Top-6-T...</a>).\nFront-end is React + in-house framework for handling data synchronization.\nFull automated end-to-end test coverage of all our features along with a growing set of unit tests to handle edge cases.

Our clients include a half-dozen Fortune 50 companies, one of them is an anchor partner in our national coalition loyalty program.

You will be joining a medium sized department of 40 who all commit to their projects as a labor of love and their lives work.

C (embedded device), Python (RESTFul web services), AngularJS, D3, MySQL, Chef, Ansible and I am certain I am missing two dozen things.<p>I manage the engineering, devops, qa and product teams.

At KickBack you will be joining an open, transparent and honest environment. You&#x27;ll be treated with respect and you won&#x27;t be required to lower your standards. Yes, we&#x27;re a for profit business so at times compromises need to be made but they are discussed, debated and the negatives are understood very well when we do so.<p>We&#x27;re like any other company, we have technical debt but we strive for perfection in ourselves and in our software product as much as the free market and customers allow. At any rate, we think our approach to management and operating a software development business is a breath of fresh air.\nI need to fill the following roles:<p><pre><code>  - Senior Frontend Developer \n  - Senior Python Developer\n  - Senior Test Automation Developer\n  - Quality Assurance Manager\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested in applying or hearing more, please email me.<p>NOTE: KRS has a healthy intern program but we keep a very personal and 1:1 relationship with our interns.<p>Unfortunately, at this time I&#x27;m not able to take on any more interns but email me in six months once these roles are filled by exceptional candidates and my team leads and developers are ready to mentor future experts.",

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available. We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>Presently we&#x27;re hiring engineers in Atlanta, Beaverton, Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Dublin, London, New York, Palo Alto, Paris, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle, Sydney, Toronto and Washington DC.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth.  We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought (well, subject to regulatory approval) by Walmart for 3.3 billion.  With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding.  And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :)\nThe Dutch government also gives a tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very\nfinely tuned through years of experience of doing this.\nIf you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at\nHacker news).\nTo have an idea of the kind of problems being solved here, you can also look at our dev blog: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.booking.com&#x2F;</a><p>We are hiring for our headquarters office in Amsterdam:<p>- Frontend developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;cxmso8</a><p>- Backend developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;g5n6oe</a><p>- Product Owners in various departments - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;edvq2n\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;edvq2n</a><p>- Data analysts - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;al15kt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;al15kt</a><p>- Data Scientist(Machine Learning) - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5uxtdv\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;5uxtdv</a><p>- iOS Developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;w1mi0y\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;w1mi0y</a><p>- Junior iOS Developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;piho2l\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;piho2l</a><p>- Android Developers - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1bnljt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;1bnljt</a><p>- UX Designer - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e23axu\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e23axu</a><p>For our office in Seattle:<p>- Software Engineer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;j0hacq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;j0hacq</a><p>- Senior Software Engineer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xpm80g\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;xpm80g</a><p>- Frontend Developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ep1qn0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;ep1qn0</a><p>- Lead Frontend Developer: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;kawx0r\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;kawx0r</a><p>For our office in Shanghai:<p>- Product owner : <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;lndjc1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;lndjc1</a><p>- Software Developer : <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;m12bjy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;m12bjy</a><p>For all available positions take a look here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;3ryvfg</a>",

        "full_html": "Zimmer Biomet (formerly Respondwell) is hiring. We\u2019re hoping to bring a couple of experienced people onboard to help us build serious games in the healthcare industry, specifically in the rehab space. We use video games to help people get back on their feet after they\u2019ve broken themselves via sprains, breaks, falls, or surgery.<p>We&#x27;re looking for two important hires: The first is a database &amp; network engineer to help us scale our current system to deal with the increased server load as we continually get more patients &amp; clinicians. This position requires serious experience with PostgreSQL, setting up failover, replication, and load balancing on the server, and writing backend Python code to interface with the server web-framework (we use CherryPy). You&#x27;ll also need experience setting up and administering a Linux VPS through AWS (mostly) or Azure (not as much).<p>The second position is a Unity3D engineer. For this position you must have experience in Unity3D and C#, and have reasonable 3D math skills. Python experience is a huge plus but not required.<p>For both of these positions we\u2019re looking for people who are self-directed and like working with cool technologies in ways that haven\u2019t been used before. This job will definitely stretch your brain.<p>These jobs are located in Portland, Oregon, and would require relocation here, with assistance provided to the right candidates. We offer great salaries, great benefits, and a chance to work on projects that actually make people feel better. We work sane hours and don&#x27;t throw around words like rockstar or ninja to describe our team. Work&#x2F;life balance is extremely important to us.<p>If any of this sounds good and you fit the descriptions of what we&#x27;re looking for, send your resume &amp; any relevant links to jobs@respondwell.com and we&#x27;ll take it from there.",
