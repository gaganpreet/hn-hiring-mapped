Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It's like building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of the right color pieces.</p><p>At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we're creative people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow, and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.</p><p>Having the best people doesn't hurt, either. We've got most of them already, and we're looking to find the rest. You can build things with us. What's the catch? We're pretty darn selective.</p><p>To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can work on every part of an application, from the data store to the page\u2013sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.</p><p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target. We're service-oriented, and you should be too.</p><p>Still reading? Please apply! And check out our Web Framework Benchmarks while you're at it. We pretty much wrote the book on that one.</p><p>Just so you know:</p><p></p><pre><code>   Teams range between 2-6 people\n   Developers are exposed to 3-4 projects per year\n   All development is done on high-performance workstations with 4K displays.

Here is a snapshot of what we're using now:<p></p><pre><code>   Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n   Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n   Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n   Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n   Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n   Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB)\n</code></pre>\nWe don't expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but we do expect you'll learn more about them every day.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to work, please apply here: <a href=\"http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2</a></p></font>",

We're hiring for full time positions as software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.</p><p>A little bit about us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - We aren't limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I've worked with Objective-C (and Swift),\n    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team.

We started this company after being embedded inside government and seeing first-hand the horrors of the technology that these folks have to use everyday. We worked on a project called RFP-EZ that made it super simple to view and bid on government contracts. It wasn't anything amazing -- just a simple Bootstrap site, but just by making this process easier to understand for web firms who don't specialize in government contracting, we were able to save the federal government an average of 30%.</p><p>We've been in business for a just under a year, and have already created dozens of success stories - governments who are using our software to save staff time, save money, and provide better experiences for citizens. We're looking to grow our team and help us scale this success to governments across the country.</p><p>Experience</p><p>We're looking to bring on a developer who fits the following:</p><p>You are experienced in Ruby and ideally, Rails\nYou have strong knowledge of SQL/Postgres\nYou have a passion for good user experience and are excited about frontend development, too\nYou are comfortable working with a 100% distributed team\nAnd last, but perhaps most important, you are as passionate as we are about our mission to revolutionize government IT</p><p>Our Culture</p><p>For many people in the technology industry, DOBT is a different kind of place to work, and a different set of people work here. Usually, they\u2019re people who value time more than they value money. While from time to time, circumstances may call for it, you aren\u2019t going to see a lot of 80 hour weeks, and depending on your time zone you might see some people who clock out at around 6.</p><p>You\u2019re probably not going to be in a work environment that has a foosball table, catered lunches, and its own mass transportation either. That\u2019s because we\u2019re a fully remote firm. While some people may opt to work together in the same space, we want people to work from wherever they feel like it. So if you\u2019ve always wanted to live in Japan, now\u2019s your chance.</p><p>Diversity</p><p>DOBT is an equal opportunity employer. We will not discriminate and will take measures to ensure against discrimination in employment, recruitment, advertisements for employment, compensation, termination, upgrading, promotions, and other conditions of employment against any employee or job applicant on the bases of race, creed, color, national origin, or sex. We are committed in all areas to providing a work environment that is free from harassment.</p><p>How to apply</p><p>Fill out the form on Screendoor: <a href=\"https://screendoor.dobt.co/dobt/developer-hiring/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://screendoor.dobt.co/dobt/developer-hiring/</a> (yay for dogfooding!)

We do this work because we believe deeply in the transformative power that learning can have on people's lives, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down the barriers that prevent many people from reaching their full potential and living empowered lives.</p><p>We started out as a group of students volunteering on the open-source KA Lite project (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>), an offline version of Khan Academy, which we first announced publicly in December of 2012. An enthusiastic global response led to a flood of requests for support, features, and partnerships, and we soon realized we needed to establish a solid foundation to support the project and the longer-term vision, so we incorporated as a nonprofit in April of 2013. We have been fortunate enough to raise some funding to support our continued work, and now have 3 full-time employees, as well as a number of contractors and interns, alongside a community of volunteers and open-source contributors. We are leasing space in the Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space on the UC San Diego campus, and collaborate closely with researchers and students across the campus.</p><p>We're now looking to grow our core team by hiring someone who will help us to drive our mission and projects forward, playing a strong collaborative and leadership role in both the development process and in the organization as a whole. We have a lot we want to accomplish, and want to continue building a positive, dynamic, and diverse team to help ensure our vision flourishes.</p><p>## Our plans</p><p>KA Lite has now been installed thousands of times in over 120 countries (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/</a>), in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in Cameroon, prisons across the United States, refugee programs in Lebanon, and First Nations community centers in northern Canada. We plan to continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user experience, and supporting deployments around the world.</p><p>Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.</p><p>## About you</p><p>* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/values/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/about/values/</a>).</p><p>* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and contractors.</p><p>* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best to serve user needs.</p><p>* You have skills and experience with web development/design, hopefully using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5, Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS/LESS (visual design tools also a plus).</p><p>* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs, etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes), Quality Assurance (automated and/or manual testing).</p><p>## About the job</p><p>* We're looking to fill a full-time position (possibly starting with a 3-month trial period contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary, 401(k) matching, and health care options. If you feel you might not yet have enough experience for the full-time position, but are excited about what we're doing, contact us anyway, as we have an internship program that could be a way to learn, and get your foot in the door!</p><p>* We offer flexible schedules and vacation time. We emphasize a healthy work-life balance, accomplishing as much as we can while also taking care of ourselves and our families, and having fun!</p><p>* Your exact title in the organization would be determined in collaboration with you, on the basis of the skills you bring to the table, and the focus of the role you'll be playing on the team. See our team page for some examples of current and past titles (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/team/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/about/team/</a>).</p><p>* You'd be working and living in sunny San Diego, at our offices on the lively UCSD campus. We can help out with relocation costs, and in certain cases we may be able to look at options for remote contract work if you're unable to move.</p><p>Apply online at <a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/about/jobs/</a>, or reach out to us with any questions at jobs@learningequality.org!</p></font>",

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that.</p><p>It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?</p><p>We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all.

We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together.</p><p>For our generalist role we'd prefer it if you have Rails and JavaScript experience; for our data roles, Python.

You know when to do it fast, when to do it\nright, and how to find the best compromise between the two.  You recognize that\nwe are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you\nfound it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal this month! Want to come?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.</p><p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.</p><p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=\"https://github.com/StackMonkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/StackMonkey</a></p><p>The fund raise for the Utter.io Open Source project will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in early 2015 via token issuance similar to Ethereum, Maidsafe or Storj.  A more traditional fund raise is currently underway for StackMonkey, and will be used to build the first of many specific knowledge based offerings on top of the technologies being built with Utter.io.</p><p>---</p><p>Objectives and Team Overview</p><p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin.

It's hard to believe but doctors are still using paper and pager to manage their team and critical patient information. They're not even allowed to use email..</p><p>We're getting amazing traction - and excitement from doctors - and we are looking to expand the team with a few key people:</p><p>1) Backend developer: We use Mongo and Node. Lots of very cool challenge in building a robust and flexible API. Experience with real-time synchronization, AWS, security, offline apps and Angular.js is definitely a plus.</p><p>2) Product/UX designer: Building an app for doctors is a big UX challenge. They're extremely busy people and are used to have access to lots of information all the time.</p><p>3) UI Designer: Doctors are tired of those ugly 1980 computer systems still in use in hospitals. They want to work with the same kind of polished and beautiful apps that they've started using at home. We're looking to push the current healthcare design status quo to a new level.</p><p>4) ios and Android developers: We're looking for great ios/android developers with an eye for design who can take a leading role in implementing beautiful and snappy native apps.</p><p>5) Machine Learning / Data geek: Right now, 75% of critical patient information is trashed at the end of the day. That information is not going back in the EMR and is totally wasted. There are so many opportunities in helping finding better diagnosis, helping doctors be more efficient, helping the departments/hospitals save time and money, etc.</p><p>6) Front-end developer: We're looking for a great front-end developer/designer who love writing clean html/css code with an attention to details (We care about those pixels). Experience with Angular.js with an eye for design is definitely a plus.</p><p>----</p><p>We're a multi-disciplinary team (Two doctors on the team) solving a massive healthcare challenge.

We\u2019re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do.

Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.</p><p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation\u2019s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).</p><p>WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby.

Our iOS apps are Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate (we\u2019ve tried RubyMotion \u2014 impressive, but probably not for us \u2014 and we\u2019re playing with Swift).

We've just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you\u2019d be our first developer hire.
