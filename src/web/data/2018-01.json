Our CEO said that strategy has changed. We need ads that keep people on eBay and offer better choices for our buyers. We are the team blowing up the old strategy and doing something better. You can move the needle when it comes to eBay&#x27;s profit. We are a small team in a growing remote office. This is a unique opportunity to learn search engine and recommendation technology which rank eBay&#x27;s 1+ billion active items. We apply cutting edge machine learning techniques on petabytes of data and thousands of Spark&#x2F;YARN nodes. This includes deep learning, XGBoost and online learning.

I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The Dutch government also gives a tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.<p>The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned through years of experience of doing this.
