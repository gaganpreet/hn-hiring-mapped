A typical Apprentice is already a productive developer in the language of their choice on the JVM, .NET, and&#x2F;or Node JS platforms at the start of the programme. They will know of Agile processes and practices and can apply them and are looking to become an expert in reasoning about them.

Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as \u2018adventures\u2019. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.<p>We are backed by one of the UK\u2019s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First.

You\u2019ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You don\u2019t have to know our whole tech stack but it\u2019s important that you\u2019re willing to learn.

You will get to show that you know what you\u2019re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.<p>We see coding as a way of communication, it\u2019s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English.

There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you&#x27;ll find to work on almost anywhere.<p>FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we&#x27;ve partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.<p>FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.<p>You&#x27;d be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we&#x27;re looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won&#x27;t be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, from training pipelines to real-time inference engines, so we&#x27;re ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so.

We&#x27;re broken into two main divisions: Pivotal Labs (<i>that</i> Pivotal Labs) and R&amp;D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well.<p>Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&amp;D</i> is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service &amp; Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire &#x2F; Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We&#x27;re adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team.
