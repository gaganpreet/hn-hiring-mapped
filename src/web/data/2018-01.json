We\u2019re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as \u2018adventures\u2019. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.<p>We are backed by one of the UK\u2019s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First. We care about our craft and it\u2019s important to us that you do as well. We\u2019re looking for someone with a couple of years of coding experience under their belt and who\u2019s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you\u2019re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it.

We don\u2019t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you\u2019re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.<p>We see coding as a way of communication, it\u2019s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English.

Instead of an endless product roadmap, we run short development cycles to test assumptions and make smart decisions quickly. This isn\u2019t a sprint and there\u2019s no project managers, we work closely with the rest of the business to make sure we deliver the most value to our customers.<p>Our stack uses Ruby for most of the backend, with Rails, PostgreSQL and Redis making up the majority of our core product. We use modern front end tooling, with ES6, React and Tachyons. When it comes to shipping code, we love GitHub code reviews and making CircleCI happy before anything gets into production. We mostly deploy to Heroku, with some heavy lifting on AWS. We favour feature flags over staging environments and deploy to production as often as we need to; deployment cycles shouldn\u2019t get in the way of delivering value.<p>We\u2019re looking for an experienced Ruby developer who thrives in small, fast-moving engineering teams.<p>If this sounds interesting, you can read more &amp; apply at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;korukids.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;622008\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;korukids.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;622008</a> or email me directly at michael [at] korukids.co.uk",

At this time we aren&#x27;t prepared to offer H1B&#x2F;Visa sponsorship or remote work.\nJOB DESCRIPTION Currently, we are working closely with our customers to rapidly prototype, build, and refine the Jellyfish platform. We are using a Django stack (Python 3, Django, Postgres) hosted on AWS, so experience with these technologies is a plus. We are also seeking to augment the team with someone with substantial experience with toolkits like scikit-learn.\nABOUT YOU Ideal candidates will have two or more years experience building software and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a computer-science-adjacent field. We will also consider equivalent experience in lieu of a degree. Familiarity with building and bringing software to market is a huge plus. As we are an early-stage startup there is the standard caveat: we&#x27;re working quite hard to quickly bring this to market, so there will be a non-zero amount of unpredictability. The flip side of that is, of course, the opportunity to join an early-stage startup working on an interesting idea.\nTECH STACK Python (Django, NumPy), PostgreSQL, AWS, Nginx COMPENSATION Competitive salary plus equity grant\nEmail resumes to jobs [at] jelly.ai or you can contact me directly asm [at] jelly.ai with questions.",

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here&#x27;s where we are now:<p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.<p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.<p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It\u2019s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.<p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the \u201cScala as a worse Haskell\u201d and \u201cScala as a better Java\u201d spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.<p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.<p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.<p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.narrative.io&#x2F;culture&#x2F;</a><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

I&#x27;m currently leading our flight tracking team, which develops and maintains a distributed system for tracking flights in parallel, and I&#x27;m in the process of building a machine learning team for the first time ever at the company.<p>This is an opportunity to have a potentially huge impact on machine learning not just at FlightAware but on the aviation industry in general. There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you&#x27;ll find to work on almost anywhere.<p>FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we&#x27;ve partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.<p>FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.<p>You&#x27;d be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we&#x27;re looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won&#x27;t be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, from training pipelines to real-time inference engines, so we&#x27;re ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so. With that said, we&#x27;re willing to consider less experienced candidates with exceptional backgrounds.<p>FA is a small company (currently 70-80 employees), but we&#x27;re not a startup.

Bright (paid) interns are also welcome. Note: some of the job roles on our website are adaptable, depending on the candidates&#x27; balance of experience and expertise and how they add to the team. You&#x27;re very welcome to email us (info &lt;At&gt; hackmind &lt;dot&gt; ai) with questions on that, and have a chat. As a startup, all of us also do all the jobs at various times where necessary.<p>A bit of background: we&#x27;re a pre-incubator in Berlin, with a deep engineering focus, and our next batch begins later this month. We give engineers plenty enough money to live here for 3 months to hack out your startup idea properly and find your (also technical) cofounder. So we help you at an earlier stage than most incibators, and we&#x27;re deeply engineering-focused.<p>Berlin is cheap and fun, but full of MBA-led company builders. Instead we&#x27;re engineer-led and aim to bring more hacker culture to this fine city. We&#x27;re bringing together lots of extremely smart engineers in one place to experiment, hack, test, and figure out what to build. So that catalyses the creation of ambitious new companies with genuinely original and - hopefully - world-changing results. We have a special focus in the ML and Deep Learning fields, and in Blockchain, but please note <i>good engineers and developers of all kinds can apply and are welcome</i>. We help  with both technical mentoring and the non-engineering things that you don&#x27;t think you can do as a startup, beginning with cofounder-finding.<p>Importantly, also to succeed you need soft skills. We love measuring things, and will help you with your metrics, and  how to develop your communication, personal and team skills.<p><pre><code>  For the second three months we fund the incorporation of your company (in any country: US, Germany, Estonia, wherever makes the most sense to your future). This part constitutes  more of the &#x27;standard&#x27; building incubator phase, with more money, offices ancillary support, and help with product and the business aspects of how to run a startup. We help you develop your product and prepare for demo for seed round or ICO. \n</code></pre>\nWe also have about 20-30% engineers with industrial engineer domain experience participating, for others of our participating engineers to team up with (12 fields, see website, including Biomedical, computational biology, materials, physics, robotics &#x2F; computer vision, energy and more).<p>You can apply through the website, or email us at [info &lt;at&gt; hackmind &lt;dot&gt; ai] with &#x27;HN&#x27; as part of the email title and I will personally reply.",
