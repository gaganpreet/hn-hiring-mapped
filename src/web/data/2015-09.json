Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit\n  sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n  with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience building\n  software with a variety of tools and technologies.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n  afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile tech.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nIf you&#x27;re interested, check out our website:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;hiring&#x2F;</a><p>Also, feel free to get in touch with me:<p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com",

Kids will be headed back to school with cartoons on their lunchboxes you no longer recognize, which is slightly disconcerting. It\u2019s a time for change. Why not consider a career change?<p>NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team. If you\u2019re a tinkerer, a breaker rather than a builder, or someone who wonders \u201cwhy\u201d and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we\u2019d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer. All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time.

Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can&#x27;t be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo&#x27;s 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;explore-opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;explore-opportunities</a>",

We work on integrating large datasets into knowledge ontologies using machine-learning techniques and performing parallelised semantic search on big data. The end result of using Ontoit search engine is that meaningful relationships can be inferred between pieces of information. These relationships can be used to perform explicit semantic search through large amounts of data. The Ontoit search engine will assist industries in a variety of fields to find information and explore ideas in an integrative manner. In order to create the proposed search engine, we intend to combine five distinct fields in computer science: ontology engineering, machine learning, natural language processing, semantic search and distributed computing.<p>Ontoit will first focus on developing one application for the movie industry. Our first product will be a semantic search engine to traverse the corpus of movie information on the internet.<p>Here at Ontoit, we develop our entire backend in one programming language, Java. Spring framework forms the backbone of our web services. We develop knowledge representations using stacks of graph databases and technologies. Natural sentence queries are parsed through an engine built using Stanford CoreNLP. Computations are distributed to a cluster developed using Apache Storm. Data crunches for Machine Learning models are parallelised using Spark. We store our data in scalable, NoSQL Cassandra.<p>Our system architecture is designed in great detail with a high degree of modularity and scalability.<p>Ontoit is currently recruiting for multiple positions:\nTeam Lead, Core Developer, NLP Developer, QA Developer.

Our codebase is well organized, documented, and tested.<p>=Jobs=<p>* Full-Stack Engineer - You will be writing application code and helping maintain&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;scale the stack. At least 6 years of Python and Linux sysadmin experience required.<p>* Python Developer - You will be writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect&#x2F;parse utility data (pdfs, html, xml, csv, etc.) from utilities. At least 1 year of Python experience required.<p>=How To Apply=<p>Email me, Daniel Roesler, a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org). You must already be able to work in the U.S.<p>=For Solar Skeptics=<p>In the last few years, the solar industry reached &quot;grid parity&quot;, which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That&#x27;s why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn&#x27;t some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).",

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 42,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 80 (33 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for senior software engineers, product managers, and analytics superstars.

Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow\u2019s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital \u2014 all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don\u2019t have to?

World-class companies (Airbnb, Mercedes, Nordstrom to mention a few) use Medallia to create awesome customer experiences.<p>We are a fast-growing (70% per year), Sequoia-backed company that recently became a tech unicorn; our mission is no less than to transform the way the world&#x27;s companies view and interact with their customers. We allow hundreds of thousands of employees to access, analyze and take action on large amounts of customer data in real time. We are still a small engineering team, only about 50 or so of us, thus everyone counts.<p>Dividing our codebase into independent microservices will make it easier for new engineers to get up to speed, enable much faster deployments of new code (by the engineers themselves) and make it easier and cheaper to scale with much better resiliency.<p>Despite the popularity of microservice architectures, and plethora of available frameworks, there are still many unsolved problems (especially around RPC performance, storage and freely moving processes around) in operating at scale in production. We not only want to solve these for ourselves, but share our findings and tools with the wider community.<p>We are using a blend of the best tech out there: Docker for containerization; Aurora&#x2F;Mesos for data center &#x2F; server management; CEPH for fully redundant storage and putting it together in a way we haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do.

Super easy to set up, with Klets, any company makes it easy and fun for their customers to chat with them.<p>Unlike live chat popups, Klets focuses on companies that want to build real long-term relationships with their customers. This means great design, great UX, and all attention to the conversation. Companies don&#x27;t need any IT skills to set up Klets, and customers can chat without downloading anything or signing up.<p>Klets is only 3 people right now, looking to hire our first intern.

We strongly believe that happy customers are the best marketing you can do, so in reality these fields are very closely related. We&#x27;re looking for someone who likes planning this out with us on a strategic level and <i>also</i> likes to execute.<p>If you&#x27;re a student looking for a (graduation) project, we can be very forthcoming with the precise contents and goals of the internship. It can be just about as practical or as academic as you need it to be to make it a great project.<p>Remote is OK, though the closer, the better. We need you to be at most 2 hours away from our timezone (CET).<p>The fact that you&#x27;re here reading this on HN means that you&#x27;re already very high on our list!

So we expect you to be a little different as well.<p>You, as the manager, are responsible for unblocking your team. You need to provide leadership, not micromanagement. You are here to help engineers achieve their goals and ambitions, provide great communication, and to help engineers ship the product.<p>You are responsible for setting the culture in your team. That culture is to make sure every engineer is happy, unblocked, doing whatever it takes to help an engineer ship, and to ensure that are no politics while doing all the above. Sparkcentral is all about output. It doesn\u2019t matter if someone is in the office 25 hours a week, so long as the team ships great things.<p>You are not just a manager, but also an engineer. You must understand how engineers think, what they crave, how much to put on their plate, when to prioritize engineer initiatives, and be able to deliver that repeatedly.<p>We want you if this sounds like what you can provide as a manger. You\u2019ll be a serious contender if you have 4+ years of experience in an agile, startup as either a lead engineer or experience in a management capacity. Working with teams in different locations is a huge plus. You must have been an engineer for a few years at some point in your career.

We are a VoD company with a focus on bringing the best films to our customers around the globe.  What sets us apart is true editorial credibility in the film world, and a strategy building social traction with a cinephile audience before putting Studio content deals in place.  That time has now come. We are at an inflection point where we will massively scale the subscriber base.  If you have been looking around the Valley and concerned that valuations are out of control and investors are chasing too many flimsy business models, then you should take a look at what we&#x27;re doing.<p>The product is a streaming service and social network currently available on the web, iOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, PlayStation, Samsung Smart TVs, and several more on the way.  It is build primarily of Ruby, Rails, Backbone + Marionette, and the usual client-side frameworks.  We are heavily invested in Chef for configuration management, both at Engine Yard where we host our main applications, and also for newer infrastructure such as our custom-built CDN that we are tuning to deliver a better QoS than off-the-shelf vendors can provide.<p>The position is for the second engineer to be sitting next to me (Co-Founder &amp; CTO) and our Head of Product in our San Francisco offices.  Although we were founded in Palo Alto, currently the CEO and bulk of our team is based in London due to the UK being our primary growth market.  We are now looking to move the product and engineering center of gravity to San Francisco in a run up to make the US a primary market in 2016 and beyond.  You would be #10 software engineer overall, and will play a strong role in defining the architecture of our application.  Strong ruby and rails skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures.  VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required.  You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email, which can be found on my MUBI profile at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mubi.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mubi.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;2</a>",

We\u2019re solving a big problem felt by almost all large companies: how to continuously train &amp; educate your workforce with modern&#x2F;relevant content.<p>One way we&#x27;re doing that is through one of the more engaging &amp; attractive interfaces in the enterprise market today. Historically, it seems that enterprise products can &quot;get away&quot; with compromising on UI&#x2F;UX, especially compared to consumer products. We don&#x27;t believe that should be the case. We strive to be a product you use daily, but in order for us to achieve that, our interface needs to meet (and exceed) the standards you experience on a daily basis.<p>We&#x27;re looking for an engineer who can focus &amp; make strides on this goal. You&#x27;ll do everything from helping define the UI&#x2F;UX for new feature releases to actual feature implementation.<p>About You<p>- You don&#x27;t test a feature in the browser without dev tools open<p>- You&#x27;re well versed in Javascript (we use Coffeescript), sans frameworks like jQuery<p>- You have experience building front-end features from conception to launch. This means extensive knowledge with CSS (we use Sass) and HTML (Haml)<p>- Perhaps you have experience in AngularJS. If not, you can learn here though<p>- Ideally, you have experience with front-end dev tools like Bower, Browsersify, Grunt, Jasmine, etc<p>- You&#x27;re used to writing unit &amp; E2E tests for your code<p>About Us<p>- We&#x27;re a Techstars NYC 2014 graduate<p>- We&#x27;ve got customers the likes of Qualcomm &amp; Twitter backing us<p>- We&#x27;re making a splash in a very antiquated industry, which means you&#x27;d be given the opportunity to design unprecedented solutions to problems that have plagued companies for quite some time<p>- On Fridays, you have the opportunity to work on or learn whatever you like. We often work on open source software (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pathgather\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pathgather</a>) or dig into new technologies<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please email me at jamie@pathgather.com.

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure! E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill). Please include in either the e-mail or the DM at least one commit (repo+SHA) from one of our open source projects that stirs you at some level:  something you found interesting, or inspiring, or unspeakably vile -- or perhaps even all three!

Next to that, more and more organisations are using our SaaS tools to stimulate and manage learning for their employees.<p>Working at Springest<p>To strengthen our development team more, we are looking for a senior Ruby developer who can work independently. We don\u2019t have managers at Springest, but processes, and we feel that individuals taking responsibility is very important. At Springest, you will work in a product team and in close collaboration with product owners, marketing, and sales colleagues. You are also a member of our development team where we discuss architecture, infrastructure, and keep a close watch on security and performance.<p>Your New Colleagues<p>At Springest you will work with around twenty colleagues who all are very skilled at what they do and almost all of them have a healthy dose of nerd skills that we really value. As a developer you fulfil an important role here that all your colleagues value and appreciate. Springeteers are a happy bunch and we often get together outside work to enjoy free time as well. Our office is a cosy place where anything goes and that we all take good care of together.<p>We are all active organisers and members of a lot of Meetups and other forms of knowledge exchange (learning is our hobby!) and we participate quite actively in the Amsterdam startup ecosystem. In addition to that we get a lot of attention for Springest being the poster boy of how HOLACRACY and GTD can work for an organisation, which in turn is due to our organisational structure without managers and other unnecessary overhead.<p>Our Data and Stack<p>At Springest you will work on our Ruby on Rails application on a daily basis. The app runs on AWS in Docker containers. You can read more about that on our blog.<p>We serve over 100 different SSL endpoints, among which are our APIs, Admin backend for learning providers, and of course our public websites. How we do that will soon be published on our blog.<p>At this time, we have over 150,000 courses by 5,000 providers in our Postgres database. Our users trust us with over 50,000 reviews already. Our exciting job is to maintain this ever scaling dataset.<p>It should not surprise you that our search engine is a core feature, for which we use Elasticsearch. We provide over 6,000 subjects in more than 150 categories with courses through this engine. We do personal recommendations for our users with it, taking their location, start dates, and many other factors into account that are important when choosing the right form of education.",

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>\u25e6 <i>skill</i>: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>\u25e6 <i>desire to learn</i>: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>\u25e6 <i>understanding</i>: our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>\u25e6 <i>clear communication</i>: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight. So, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

We&#x27;re a hugely successful unicorn that is looking for a number of people to fill a few critical positions as we look to grow our next few billion in valuation.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to come in and lead our build and release team. The team has been growing into its own and has a ton of challenges supporting a few hundred engineers as they battle tech debt converting a monolithic backend into a cohesive set of beautiful modern services. You should be interested in leading teams that teach people to fish and write tools and services to enable scale. You should be a good product owner for highly technical work and be excited to have tons of other engineers as your stakeholders. You should feel confident that this is a job you are excited to do, if it is, you are probably a good fit.<p>We want a director and a few engineers to help grow our tools and services team. Tools and services are a set of scrum teams that do things like work on frameworks in scala, nodejs, and php that other teams will leverage to automate creation of the core features a good CK service uses. You&#x27;ll also have teams that are building a highly scalable notifications framework, a core administrative interface, and a variety of other things that we really need full time teams working on now that we scale. Just like build and release, you&#x27;ll have stakeholders who are all engineers and should be excited about those challenges. You&#x27;ll also help us break ground on some of our earliest open source projects (we&#x27;re late to the game).<p>Staff Software Engineers are what we title our best of the best. If you are the one in your company thinking &quot;I&#x27;m the smartest person in the room&quot; and &quot;I wish I had some real peers to talk to about this challenging problem&quot; you probably fit our definition. We have an extremely sharp team with some fantastic engineers who are looking to grow their ranks at the top. If you are excited about topics like domain driven design, distributed systems, high scalability, dockerization, android and ios development, and react and flux; this is a good stop for you.<p>Finally, we&#x27;re looking for a couple engineering managers. If you want to take a scrum team (~5 people) in our financial health (how our customers get tons of value out of CK), data engineering (how we figure out things that are useful for our customers), or tools and services (how our teams get stuff done) we need help. In addition to having managed technical folks: you should either have previously been a senior software engineer or have some serious program management skills to bring to bear.<p>If you are interested, hit me up matt dot greenberg at creditkarma.com (engineering director who volunteers to help with technical team hiring).

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia AT THE END OF THIS MONTH...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $5m funding and have a small team of 14 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.\nWe use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> .

Buckle up and hold on tight, you&#x27;re about to learn a crap ton here!!<p>Lead Software Engineer, iOS&#x2F;Android \nNo, we don&#x27;t expect you to build both iOS and Android apps by yourself.

We&#x27;re looking for a savvy individual who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.<p>You&#x27;ll be working alongside a tight, driven team right in the heart of the profit center. Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>About Connexity:<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>Position #1: Rails + exposure to Scala &amp; Hbase<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>Position #2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible<p>We need someone to help our Data Science team operations.  You&#x27;ll help us maintain and activate various data-driven ad targeting.  For example, a client may provide us a billion records which we need to analyze and transform into an audience segment.  This isn&#x27;t a software engineering position, but you&#x27;ll want to be (or learn to be) pretty capable at the command line, and able to work with Python&#x2F;Bash or other scripting languages.  More than anything, we want someone who can maintain order among various client-facing tasks.  On paper, we have a neat structured process; in reality, we need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward.  If you like combing through data in Excel, R or similar, this might be a great fit.  If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to get your hands on large amounts of data from an analysis or management perspective, please reach out to us.<p>--\nUnless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",
