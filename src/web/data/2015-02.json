We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers. We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors. Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg. We're solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too. Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 / Backbone.js / Django / Python / Postgres / Heroku / Ubuntu, but we're a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We're also hiring for a \"Special Operations Associate\" which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business. Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person. Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background. This position is great for an ambitious analytical mind looking to join a \"rocket ship\" startup. Obviously, this position presents a significant growth opportunity.</p><p>Rinse has excellent customer service, and we'd like to continue improving it with a Customer Service Specialist.  This individual will lead a team of customer service associates, while enjoying close support from our technology and operations teams.  The ideal candidate will have managed customer service in a consumer-focused startup environment.</p><p>Finally, Rinse is looking for a Business Development Manager to \"hustle\" and cement new business relationships as we grow.  If you like going out and meeting small business owners, this is your gig!</p><p>Any applicant who we interview will receive $25 in free Rinse credit...

At present we all work core hours in GMT (give or take a few hours), but please get in touch anyway if you're elsewhere and might be able to anchor a group of developers in your part of the world.<p>We're hiring mid-level &amp; senior developers and people with experience scaling up -- this isn't a checklist, but we're interested in sharding, ZeroMQ (kicking the tires now), systems monitoring (currently mostly Munin/Perl and shell scripts), performance and load testing, continuous integration (we use Jenkins and Selenium tests), automating server builds and server hardening (we deploy to RHEL).  Aside from the challenges around scaling, we also just need people working on core features -- more on our stack below.</p><p>Bonus points for significant experience in healthcare (as an intelligent patient or family member counts!); ditto for experience building things from scratch (i.e., not just implementing specs you're given, using the tools the tech lead gave you).</p><p><i>More about PKB</i></p><p>I've worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.</p><p>PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.</p><p>We're building something that actively, <i>directly</i>, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable.  If you're interested in PKB's growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I'm the CTO.</p><p>We're solving interesting problems, tech-wise; each person's clinical data is encrypted separately, and only the person plus their carers &amp; medical teams granted access can decrypt the private keys (so: I can't decrypt your data even for tech support purposes).  On the front end, we need to make sometimes confusing medical data accessible and useful to the patient and their carers, without removing the crucial details that the professionals need to see; across a wide range of browsers and devices (though I'll admit, supporting old IE is the kind of problem that's hard without being interesting).  We also build apps on our REST API; these are currently based on Steroids/PhoneGap (JavaScript at heart).</p><p>Our core tech stack is solid Java enterprise -- very stable but not bleeding edge; but we'll gently dissuade you from writing the AbstractManagerFactory you consider in a moment of weakness.  Secondly, we're in the process of tearing apart and rebuilding (I suspect we'll permanently be in this process, honestly) -- one major benefit of our architecture becoming increasingly modular will be that we'll be able to replace major components with whatever fits the bill.  If you're allergic to Java, check back with us next year.</p><p>Finally, we're pragmatic about work/life balance.  I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live.  Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I'm with my kids in the morning, sometimes at lunchtime, then late-afternoon &amp; evening (while my wife works), and I fill in a bit of extra working time around the edges as needed.  We're collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what's effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall.  One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he's also a theatre director.</p><p>Culture -- we're fairly diverse; we live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, and Vienna; we range in age (though I don't actually know everyone's ages, so I can't say exactly!).  We're not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn't catch something.  We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we're on the same team.  We're not the sort of group to tell dirty jokes, or tales of how drunk we got last weekend; though we do have interesting stories to share (you can find some of mine in my HN history).</p><p>If we sound like a good match, get in touch: <a href=\"https://www.patientsknowbest.com/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.patientsknowbest.com/careers.html</a> (I'm also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email)</p></font>",

Hiring Application Security Consultants\nFull-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available.<p>February - The shortest month of the year, and one of the coldest (maybe not so much in our Sunnyvale, CA location).  That month every year when we set aside some time to show appreciation for our loved ones through gifts, greeting cards, dinner dates, flowers, and a well considered application security posture.</p><p>Maybe that last one isn't on everyone's minds, but it is here at Matasano Security.  In many environments, while application security is desirable, it generally isn't a primary requirement.  Applications need to perform their core purpose, whatever that may be, so they can aid business by driving revenue.  The conflicting priorities can lead developers to make poor design decisions, rush implementations, and spend less time considering attack scenarios than would be ideal.  This isn't their fault!  It's a function of conflicting priorities and focusing on those which are most tangible, and most measure.</p><p>At Matasano this balance is different.  Application security is our passion, and our goal is to fill the unmet needs our clients have to strengthen their posture.  Our singular focus on security helps us maintain an aptitude and laser guided precision that's far above the mean.  We truly enjoy combing through code, reviewing the flow of information into and out of an application, and finding places where malicious actors can leverage vulnerabilities to their advantage.  We love our clients, but it's not the sort of love you'll read about on little candy hearts.  We tell them the truth about their security, not just rosy platitudes.</p><p>Sometimes this can mean delivering bad news when we're able to totally compromise an application and execute our own code on its server.  Other times it means explaining that when the server asks the client to identify itself, the client can just lie.  Often it means explaining that their homegrown encryption scheme is no more unintelligible than Pig Latin.  But with this bad news comes some assistance and guidance to help them prioritize improvements and strengthen their products.</p><p>This sort of work requires a very particular set of skills.  A strong Application Security Consultant needs to deeply understand programming and application design.  They require a foundation in the common application vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and mitigations.  But more than this they need to be creative and able to maintain multiple perspectives simultaneously to find places where those perspectives are in conflict.  They need to quickly learn and teach themselves, their peers, and their clients.  Above all, they need to be able to communicate well and provide actionable advice to our clients.</p><p>If you want to see more about the sorts of things we do and love, here's some resources;\n Our blog - <a href=\"http://chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chargen.matasano.com</a>\n The Matasano Crypto Challenges - <a href=\"http://cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cryptopals.com</a>\n Microcorruption, Embedded Security CTF - <a href=\"http://microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://microcorruption.com</a></p><p>If you think you have what we need, or just want to learn more about us, visit <a href=\"http://matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://matasano.com/careers</a> or contact us via careers@matasano.com.</p></font>",

My Geometry midterm was this Tuesday. I was worried, because I barely passed my Algebra one last year. Enter Khan Academy. It was great practice, as they had a good amount questions where you had to manipulate on screen variables, rather than just answer multiple choice questions. This stood out to me, as my school gives tests with these types of questions and no other review site i found had them. We got our scores back, and I was the only person in my class that got an A. It's not really an \"inspiring\" story, but hey, I figured I'd share it anyway.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Mia might not think so, but her story does inspire and makes me happy to go to work here. Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>A few things we're currently working on building right now:</p><p>\u2013 Major improvements to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)

We're looking to hire senior software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.</p><p>A little bit about us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - We aren't limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great\n    opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I've worked with Python (Flask+SQLAlchemy),\n    Objective-C (and some Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js (with CoffeeScript),\n    QT, Node.js, and a good helping of Ruby and Rails.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design. Last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per week.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n    We pair when it makes sense.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience building\n    software with a variety of tools and technologies.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile tech.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software developer on this awesome team.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",

You write out your answers and we manually review it.</p><p>2. Pair program with one startup.\nAfter we review your work, you get assigned to one of our partner startups. You\u2019ll pair program and answer a couple technical questions via screen share for an hour. The project you'll work on is the same one that everyone uses, so it doesn\u2019t matter which startup you get paired with.</p><p>3. One interview. Shared with many companies.\nWe share your pair programming session and interview with all our partner startups, including the ones you didn\u2019t interview with. Your work speaks for itself, and any company interested will reach out to you for an on-site interview.</p><p>Right now, the application is only for <i>front-end engineers</i> at our partner startups.</p><p>Start applying here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/dqrrIiy20x\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goo.gl/forms/dqrrIiy20x</a></p><p>If you want more information, feel free to check out www.symni.com.</p></font>",
