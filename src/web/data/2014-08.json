San Francisco (full time) or US remote.<p>You can work on Clojure at quite a few companies, but rarely can you impact millions of people at such a personal level. Walmart's mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success.\nWe started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.</p><p>Our team has a unique environment. We're still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we pair program when it best suits the task. We use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product and project management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.\nWhat we're all about</p><p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 140 million people every week. It's a tough balance but we've found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.</p><p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contibuting back to the clojure &amp; open source community\n  - having an engaging team culture and environment\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p></p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nWe are just a part of:<p></p><pre><code>  - Walmart is the world's largest retailer and one of the world's top online \n    retailers. The scale of challenges and potential impact is enormous.\n  - Walmart is actually a group of retail businesses spread all over the world\n    including Sam's Club, Asda (UK), Massmart, Walmart International\n  - WalmartLabs is a software development shop responsible for tools, platforms \n    and applications for new products in all Walmart businesses. These \n    include platform tools, data analytics &amp; machine learning, search engines, \n    mobile applications and physical retail tools.\n  - WalmartLabs Mobile builds mobile applications and backend services for all \n    Walmart businesses.\n</code></pre>\nDoes this sound like something you're into?

In fact, it was ranked the #2  place to work in Massachusetts and we're the fastest growing non-public software company in the US (and 33rd fastest growing non-public company).  We focus on helping businesses with their online marketing - specifically helping them to avoid interrupting and annoying their customers with bad marketing.</p><p>In Engineering, we're organized into small teams where you get to have a big impact on the product.  We have a great environment to move quickly in and deploy hundreds of times a day.  We use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, an internal deployer system for zero-downtime deploys, and we even have a Heroku-style system coming (for those that would ask \"why not just use Docker?\", there's still the provisioning and routing issue).</p><p>On the backend, we use Java and Python (though more Java these days).  It's really modern Java.  We use Dropwizard which is really wonderful if you haven't checked it out (annotate paths similarly to how you'd use Flash in Python and just have the method return an object and Jackson will serialize it into JSON and return it - Java can be really nice).  For data, HBase, Hadoop, MySQL, ZoopKeeper, Redis, and Memcached all have their place.  Again, we deploy hundreds of times a day so don't expect your code to languish in the repository.  We like pushing small changes fast.</p><p>On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.

We mostly work in Java, but you\u2019ll get bonus points for server/backend, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript, or machine learning experience. You\u2019ll get to design and develop large scale data processing systems, work alongside a talented set of peers, and make an impact beyond what is possible at a large, bureaucratic company.</p><p>We offer a highly competitive salary and stock compensation package, including 100% employee coverage for medical, dental, life, and disability insurance.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that.<p>It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?</p><p>We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here's my take on the space: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567</a></p><p>Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it.</p><p>You'd be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together.</p><p>For our generalist role we'd prefer it if you have Rails experience; for our data roles, Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.</p><p>I lead engineering at Close, and I'm also happy to chat for coffee if you're interested in startups, this problem space, or if you're interested in the product itself.</p><p>Email jennie+HN@close.co.</p></font>",

It would be very useful to provide some links to test code that you have written.\n\n  - Proven experience with writing code for at least two of Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, Android, iOS or WinRT. MaidSafe code is expected to run on all of these. Again links to examples would be great.\n\n  - Proven experience with writing C++ 11/14 code, especially using the C++ 11/14 STL. Links to examples please!\n\n  - A presence on Stack Overflow, where you have asked or answered hard questions and recognised by others for your answers.\n\n  - At least a minimum of experience writing C++ which works on Microsoft C++ compiler.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years. We\u2019ll need the best minds out there to help us make that happen.</p><p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek as quickly as possible.</p><p>My two co-founders developed the basis of our approach at the University of Utah, using it to find two very promising candidates for a serious and fairly common genetic disease. We\u2019re moving those candidates forward, and at the same time adapting the approach to address the thousands of other untreated rare genetic diseases as quickly as we can. I joined them to start this company because this is the best chance I\u2019ve found for a software/stats person to make such a huge impact on the lives of millions of people. I also believe that imaging-based biological experiments are going to be a big part of the wave of advancement coming to treating and curing diseases in the next two decades.</p><p>--</p><p>Software Engineer (Python):</p><p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You\u2019re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.</p><p>- You\u2019re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients\u2019 lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.</p><p>- You\u2019ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we\u2019ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.</p><p>--</p><p>Lead Data Scientist (Python):</p><p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems and answering questions efficiently using lots of data, preferably using ipython and lots of python\u2019s scientific programming tools. We\u2019re not hadoop-scale for now, but every experiment can generate hundreds of gigs of quantitative measurements.</p><p>- You\u2019re ready to take on any problem and figure out the best solution you can with available time, having fun in the process.</p><p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re excited to learn what you need to (we\u2019ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.</p><p>- You\u2019re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients\u2019 lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.</p><p>- You\u2019ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.</p><p>- You\u2019ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of exeriments. You\u2019ll set the groundwork for how we\u2019ll design and analyzse thousands of experiments in the coming years.</p><p>--</p><p>About Recursion:</p><p>We work in a beautiful office and lab space set directly at the base of the mountains, overlooking Salt Lake City, situated directly one floor above the drug discovery core at the University of Utah, giving us direct access to millions of dollars of cutting edge lab automation and imaging equipment.

I think we were the first company in the world to successfully pull off a live 4Kp60 broadcast. We're working with many of the biggest names in the industry (ESPN, HBO, Comcast, BBC, etc.), and being involved in events like the World Cup and Olympics is a lot of fun.</p><p>Even though we have ~140 people now, Elemental still definitely has a startup feel -- almost everyone does a lot of new feature development. The team is extremely competent -- the most competent I have ever been a part of. Our products generally have 4 layers:</p><p>* A video codec written in C (with some CUDA -- we have GPU accelerated codecs)</p><p>* A C++ media engine that basically takes the aforementioned codec and does useful stuff with it (this is what I work on)</p><p>* A process manager written in Ruby</p><p>* A Ruby on Rails UI that basically takes in a bunch of user settings and converts it into an XML file that gets passed into the media engine</p><p>* We also have a cloud product that runs on top of AWS</p><p>The benefits at Elemental are amazing, and too numerous to list here.

We work with non-profits, foundations, and small businesses. While we work with non-profits and foundations, we\u2019re a for-profit company and offer competitive salaries and benefits. Our main industry is K-12 education, but we also have projects in public accountability. One reason our clients prefer working with us is because we build pilot projects to demonstrate success prior to building out larger applications. For us, this means lots of opportunities for building projects from scratch, allowing us to work with the latest and greatest development tools and frameworks.</p><p>You will be working with our team of developers, designers, and subject matter experts to build software that solves real problems. We build in an agile manner with direct user feedback as part of our design/development cycle. You will have the opportunity to mentor others on the team while working with our senior developers. Our current stack leans towards Angular on the client side and Rails on our API server. Our developers are a curious sort though, so we will continue to adjust our stack as new technologies emerge.</p><p>As our front end expert you should be able to create directives, resources, services, controllers, and all the other fun parts of Angular with ease. We use package managers and build systems. We like speeding things up by using Bootstrap or Foundation, so familiarity would be great. Getting the most out of SASS and LESS will also help. Do you like automated testing? Us too! We use Jasmine, Karma, and CircleCi. We also can\u2019t get enough of Github and have a strong code review culture.</p><p>The majority of the team is in Washington, DC but we also have members in NYC, Richmond, VA and Medellin, Colombia.</p><p>If you are interested shoot me an email at job@mobility-labs.com</p></font>",

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.</p><p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.</p><p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=\"https://github.com/StackMonkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/StackMonkey</a></p><p>The fund raise for the company will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in late September via token issuance similar to Maidsafe or Storj.</p><p>---</p><p><i>Objectives and Team Overview</i></p><p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin.  Individuals are expected to be experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the other.</p><p>I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python/JavaScript, have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started, run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their careers.  I believe passionately in this project because infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy.  To me, there is not greater cause and it is now my life's mission to see this vison to fruition.</p><p>---</p><p><i>Desired Skills</i></p><p>Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts, scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture, distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks, including AppEngine and Flask,  UX/UI/design experience with operational software, and developer focused evangelism.</p><p>If you find this opportunity interesting, worthy of your passion and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in your career, please drop me a line.  I'm kordless at stackmonkey dot com.</p><p>Thank you for reading and best of luck in all that you do!  These are exciting times.</p></font>",

We're already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here's what's awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it\u2019s time to hire a UX/UI designer.</p><p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they\u2019re flying through their day.</p><p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it\u2019s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.</p><p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we\u2019ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, \u2018make this button blue\u2019 or it could be more elaborate like, \u2018add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,\u2019 or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they\u2019ve noticed small, nice design improvements.</p><p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they\u2019re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.</p><p>List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we\u2019re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.</p><p>We\u2019re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We\u2019re small (3 in-office employees) and we\u2019re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we\u2019re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.\nSend an email to fintechw14@gmail.com telling us about yourself. Include a resume and a portfolio if possible.</p></font>",

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.\nWe have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:<p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts' dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.</p><p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.</p><p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps. We have a great team of designers and developers, and Yahoo mobile is actually now the largest mobile development organization in the world! We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.</p><p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!</p><p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don't have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!</p><p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!</p></font>",

We\u2019re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.</p><p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation\u2019s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).</p><p>WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We\u2019ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we\u2019re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don\u2019t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.</p><p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE. We\u2019re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important \u2014 and usually the hardest \u2014 thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.</p><p>WHERE WE\u2019RE AT. Geographically we\u2019re currently at Nuffield Health's offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices), but a move to London (or just possibly Brighton) is likely in the works over the next 6 months. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you\u2019d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.</p><p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk</p></font>",

In the past year, I've worked with Objective-C (and Swift),\n    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it.

You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more.

Tasks involve making software design and architecture decisions together with the relevant team members, hacking on features alone or together, motivating the team, and keeping tabs on our (very light-weight) kanban-esque process.</p><p>Previous leadership experience is welcome, but experienced programmers who are looking to extend their leadership skills are most welcome as well. We're not very hierarchically organized so typically you'll \"lead by programming\" (and code-reviewing), not by Excel and sticky notes.</p><p>In case you care, our stack is React+TypeScript on the frontend, plus SASS/Foundation for a nice responsive mobile web experience. We do cross-platform C#/Mono on the backend (no Microsoft-lock-in here: current dev team consists of OSX, Linux <i>and</i> Windows users), all data in PostgreSQL, and Docker for deployment. When we grow, we'll probably want to add fancy trendy data stores (like Neo4J or Redis) so you'll have plenty nice new things to work out. We don't really care whether you have particular experience with any of the aforementioned technologies, as long as you have decent full-stack web dev experience. So if you know Ruby, Python, OCaml, CoffeeScript and LESS, then hey, let's talk :-)</p><p>Izooble (<a href=\"https://izooble.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://izooble.com</a>) is a Social Recommendation Platform for products in which people use their social networks to \ufb01nd, share and buy products online.

One of your responsibilities will be to make sure the remote team members don't miss out on what happens in the office, so it would be good if you can be in the office quite frequently. But not necessarily daily, depending on how far away you live: We'll happily hire a good candidate who lives 2 hours away without demanding relocation.</p><p>If you're interested or have any questions, get in touch with me personally, via my HN profile.

We've already ported Docker to ARM CPUs and have hit quite a few more Linux, Docker &amp; ARM related milestones internally.\nWe are a company founded and led by developers and have a strong engineering-led culture.

The product is still young so you'll get a chance to have real impact on how the end result looks and feels to our users.\nBesides strong Linux skills, familiarity with Docker will help a lot. Much of our codebase (on cloud and device) is in node.js so JavaScript skill is a plus.</p><p>The Process</p><p>-----------</p><p>Send us your CV (a pointer to source code online is a great plus). Those that pass a phone interview will receive a small but paid project as a test.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are going to Portugal in September! Want to come?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

Our core mission is twofold: to provide a platform for chefs to grow their independent businesses, while making it possible for people to connect over great food.</p><p>- Line chefs at the nicest restaurants in the world make at most $12-15/hour, yet the food they make is sold to diners at a hefty markup. We're trying to bridge the gap.</p><p>- People are conditioned to expect great food in restaurants \u2014 and rarely elsewhere. We want to change the way people eat, while preserving the efficiency and hospitality of a great restaurant experience.</p><p>- Most internet service companies attempt to decrease human interaction through software efficiency. We\u2019re building a company that does the opposite. We think there's something magical about having a chef in your kitchen while you relax and enjoy the company of your guests.</p><p>How we're doing it:</p><p>- We\u2019re committed to code quality and productivity. With those values in mind, we pair program, test drive and practice continuous integration in a Rails environment. We don't work 'startup hours', just normal ones.</p><p>- We're a small team (currently 6 engineers). We rotate often between pairs and across projects.</p><p>- We deploy code whenever we finish a feature. As an example, last week we deployed to production 35 times.</p><p>- We have a collaborative culture where engineers work directly with product managers and designers to find the best solution to user problems.</p><p>- We work out of a townhouse in Gowanus right now, but are moving to Soho very soon.</p><p>Who we're looking for:</p><p>- You're interested in working with Rails and pair programming the majority of the time. You want to write tests for any feature you implement.</p><p>- You're more interested in building a great product and shipping features than you are in figuring out the cleverest solution to a problem.</p><p>- You want to enjoy coming to work each day.</p><p>My name is Dan, I'm an engineer here at Kitchensurfing. If you're interested in learning more, please get in touch: dan AT kitchensurfing DOT com</p></font>",

Our industry-based mentors ensure that students receive the support that they need to learn.</p><p>Our Story</p><p>We were born out of two acquired startups and still retain the culture and practices of a lean / agile startup, but have all the resources and benefits of a public company (our parent company, Apollo Education Group, made over 3.5 billion in revenue last year). We\u2019re a young company looking for people looking to help shape our culture.</p><p>Our Team</p><p>We\u2019re a diverse team made of:\n- A Bonnaroo Guitarist\n- The world\u2019s preeminent scholar on Toilet Based Social Networks\n- A philosopher king with a sweet spot for ice cream</p><p>Our engineers write pristine, well-tested code. We pride ourselves in developer happiness. SkilledUp uses a pull request based workflow, continuous integration. We think Ruby on Rails, Trello, Github, and Heroku are the best tools.
