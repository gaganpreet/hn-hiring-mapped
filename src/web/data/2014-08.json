San Francisco (full time) or US remote.<p>You can work on Clojure at quite a few companies, but rarely can you impact millions of people at such a personal level. Walmart's mobile apps are highly rated and the services we write to support them are the base of that success.\nWe started from a small company acquisition with a single product. Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.</p><p>Our team has a unique environment. We're still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we pair program when it best suits the task. We use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product and project management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.\nWhat we're all about</p><p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 140 million people every week. It's a tough balance but we've found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.</p><p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contibuting back to the clojure &amp; open source community\n  - having an engaging team culture and environment\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p></p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nWe are just a part of:<p></p><pre><code>  - Walmart is the world's largest retailer and one of the world's top online \n    retailers. The scale of challenges and potential impact is enormous.\n  - Walmart is actually a group of retail businesses spread all over the world\n    including Sam's Club, Asda (UK), Massmart, Walmart International\n  - WalmartLabs is a software development shop responsible for tools, platforms \n    and applications for new products in all Walmart businesses. These \n    include platform tools, data analytics &amp; machine learning, search engines, \n    mobile applications and physical retail tools.\n  - WalmartLabs Mobile builds mobile applications and backend services for all \n    Walmart businesses.\n</code></pre>\nDoes this sound like something you're into?

Experience of Raven would be a fantastic bonus but it's so easy to use you can learn it on the job - so not essential.</p><p>You should be comfortable with JavaScript and jQuery and at least have an understanding of CSS.</p><p>==In summary, must-haves==</p><p>- C#\n- great communication skills\n- a can-do attitude\n- ASP.NET MVC\n- experience of working in eCommerce or some other fast-moving consumer-facing web app</p><p>Experience of any of the following would be helpful:</p><p>- RavenDB (or other document db)\n- Lucene\n- git\n- building platforms with an configurable workflows, behaviours, themes, plugins, etc\n- JavaScript / CoffeeScript\n- Azure\n- Payment Providers (Stripe, PayPal and others)</p><p>==This is a huge task but the rewards are equally great:==</p><p>- reusability is a goal: and nothing is more satisfying for a developer than successful reuse\n- our clients tend to be startups themselves, so you get to help create not one but multiple new businesses \n- as an early-stage employee, you can share financially in the success you help bring about\n- We want to build our team out with talented, self-starting developers.  This is an amazing opportunity to work in a developer-led company, using great technology on a product that is getting more and more popular all the time.</p><p>Remote working: Ideally we would like someone within commuting distance of London but we welcome applications for remote working for exceptional candidates with fantastic communication skills and a successful track record of remote working.</p><p>Please contact gaz@codetrip.co.uk</p></font>",

There are also two other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.</p><p>The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level. If you're looking for a high-impact job, this is it!</p><p>================================</p><p>We want to focus on building features around this idea of storytelling with data (see example at the end), as well as re-do our UI and design to be cleaner and up to modern standards, and to add better visualization capabilities. We look at NYtimes data driven articles with envy. We salivate when we see Tufte's work.</p><p>We need <i>you</i>, dear designer / frontend engineer, to make all that a reality!</p><p>We use d3.js for the visualizations. We know that at least the visualization part would be ideally suited for a single page app, and we'd love to implement that with Angular / Backbone / etc. We want to rethink our designs.</p><p>Especially with the new national projects with Colombia and Mexico, you'll have free rein over the creative process and the technological aspects of your work.</p><p>==================================</p><p>We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it's jquery / d3.</p><p>Everything we do is open source: <a href=\"https://github.com/cid-harvard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cid-harvard</a> and we use Github for bug/feature tracking.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Coming from the startup world, the work environment is pretty laid back, but everyone is expected to hold their own and get their work done without being micromanaged. No late nights and weekends, although I've been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.</p><p>We're a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I've been here only for a few months, but I've been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you'll have.</p><p>I'm looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality. We have great plans and dreams for the future of this site, and we need people to help. We'd love to hear more about you and see work samples if possible! Get in touch at mali_akmanalp at hks dot harvard dot edu.</p><p>Cheers,\n~mali</p><p>=================================</p><p>An example of how the atlas is useful take this story here:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/how-much-europe-depends-on-russian-energy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/h...</a></p><p>The EU recently placed sanctions sales of oil equipment, but not on oil imports. Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia's exports are petrol products:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all...</a></p><p>And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...</a> and <a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2710/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...</a></p><p>The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/sho...</a></p><p>There\u2019s practically no one who\u2019s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It\u2019s interesting how it\u2019s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that\u2019s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front. It\u2019s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all...</a></p><p>Which probably explains why EU hasn't placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.</p></font>",

In fact, it was ranked the #2  place to work in Massachusetts and we're the fastest growing non-public software company in the US (and 33rd fastest growing non-public company).  We focus on helping businesses with their online marketing - specifically helping them to avoid interrupting and annoying their customers with bad marketing.</p><p>In Engineering, we're organized into small teams where you get to have a big impact on the product.  We have a great environment to move quickly in and deploy hundreds of times a day.  We use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, an internal deployer system for zero-downtime deploys, and we even have a Heroku-style system coming (for those that would ask \"why not just use Docker?\", there's still the provisioning and routing issue).</p><p>On the backend, we use Java and Python (though more Java these days).  It's really modern Java.  We use Dropwizard which is really wonderful if you haven't checked it out (annotate paths similarly to how you'd use Flash in Python and just have the method return an object and Jackson will serialize it into JSON and return it - Java can be really nice).  For data, HBase, Hadoop, MySQL, ZoopKeeper, Redis, and Memcached all have their place.  Again, we deploy hundreds of times a day so don't expect your code to languish in the repository.  We like pushing small changes fast.</p><p>On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.  We also have our iPhone and Android applications.</p><p>Engineers get a lot of responsibility from the start and you'll usually push changes your first day.  You'll also get a Retina MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt display.</p><p>Work schedules are flexible.  Most engineers keep a 10-6 schedule.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic.  Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people.  That's the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.</p><p>Software Engineering: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3N1tAgwC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobvite.com/m?3N1tAgwC</a></p><p>All Jobs: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3S1tAgwH\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobvite.com/m?3S1tAgwH</a></p></font>",

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that.<p>It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?</p><p>We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here's my take on the space: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567</a></p><p>Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it.</p><p>You'd be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together.</p><p>For our generalist role we'd prefer it if you have Rails experience; for our data roles, Python.

The first step is a phone screen to solve a small programming problem. Then we\u2019ll schedule an on-site interview for a few hours, where you'll present for 15 minutes on any topic you'd like, have you walk through some of our code with us, and then deep-dive into the whole stack.

This doesn't mean that everyone just works long hours and burns out - no, it seems everyone is careful about being at their mental peak and intend to stay that way. This informs every aspect of the culture here: planning, creating, getting feedback, paying off technical debt, retrospectives, always thinking about how to work better and more easily, time off, going to conferences, health care, 401k.

If you\nwant to help change that, come join us.</p><p>Packetzoom is rethinking the whole stack from the ground up. You get to hack\nnetwork and/or security protocols, innards of mobile operating systems and\nbuild a global distributed system around brand new protocols. It's a very\nsmall (but well funded) team so everyone contributes in everything. But\nfollowing two are the roles where we have specific needs to fill right now.</p><p><i>1) SENIOR ENGINEERING LEADER</i></p><p>IF you have shipped products or built services where you (at least) actually\nhad to deal with unix at the syscall level (either in the userspace or kernel)\nin C/C++ code, I want to talk to you. If you've shipped and <i>maintained</i> the\nproduct for a few years, I really want to talk to you. You'd be responsible\nfor leading the team the team that builds and runs the packetzoom protocol on\nmobile clients (iOS, Android and any others we decide to pursue) as well as\nour globally distributed cluster of servers. No pressure ;-)</p><p><i>2) UNIX HACKER WITH AN ANDROID BENT</i></p><p>IF you're the kind of person who isn't happy until you've fixed up your\nandroid phone so you can ssh into it to, say, kill offending processes and/or\nrun cron jobs,  I want to talk to you. You'd be responsible for our Android\nplatform (so you'd be writing some combination of Java and C++ code). In the\nprocess, you'd get to learn all about vagaries of mobile platforms and mobile\nnetworks at the global scale. In addition, you'll have your pick of dozens of\ndelicious, hard problems to solve in the realm of distributed systems, unix'y\nthings, iOS stuff, security stuff etc. if you're so inclined.</p><p>I'm a Founder/CEO/CTO. You will work directly with me.

I think we were the first company in the world to successfully pull off a live 4Kp60 broadcast. We're working with many of the biggest names in the industry (ESPN, HBO, Comcast, BBC, etc.), and being involved in events like the World Cup and Olympics is a lot of fun.</p><p>Even though we have ~140 people now, Elemental still definitely has a startup feel -- almost everyone does a lot of new feature development. The team is extremely competent -- the most competent I have ever been a part of. Our products generally have 4 layers:</p><p>* A video codec written in C (with some CUDA -- we have GPU accelerated codecs)</p><p>* A C++ media engine that basically takes the aforementioned codec and does useful stuff with it (this is what I work on)</p><p>* A process manager written in Ruby</p><p>* A Ruby on Rails UI that basically takes in a bunch of user settings and converts it into an XML file that gets passed into the media engine</p><p>* We also have a cloud product that runs on top of AWS</p><p>The benefits at Elemental are amazing, and too numerous to list here.

Resource accounting inside the network is settled with Bitcoin and purchases of compute instances can be made by users without an account. Additionally, groups of operators can form adhoc hybrid clouds, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. If you are familiar with cloud terminology, this idea may be one possible solution to some of the challenges in achieving a global cloud federation.</p><p>It is my belief that crypto currency technologies can bring a new category to the existing cloud offerings of compute, storage, and network. That new category is trust. While conversations about how crypto currencies affect our financial systems are definitely interesting, paying for compute, storage and network with stored trust is an awe inspiring vision of the future.</p><p>More information is available on the public Github repos for the project (keep in mind the utter.io site is not live yet): <a href=\"https://github.com/StackMonkey\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/StackMonkey</a></p><p>The fund raise for the company will be done using decentralized raise methodologies sometime in late September via token issuance similar to Maidsafe or Storj.</p><p>---</p><p><i>Objectives and Team Overview</i></p><p>This is a pre-raise, core team buildout of roughly 4-5 individuals who will join me in an Open Source project that spans two distinct technologies: OpenStack and Bitcoin.  Individuals are expected to be experts in at least one of these fields and moderately versed in the other.</p><p>I am 47, well versed in both technologies, program in Python/JavaScript, have written all the software to date in the repositories, have started, run and exited other startups, live in the SF Bay Area, excel at fund raising, marketing, leading, and enabling individuals to grow in their careers.  I believe passionately in this project because infrastructure is meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy.  To me, there is not greater cause and it is now my life's mission to see this vison to fruition.</p><p>---</p><p><i>Desired Skills</i></p><p>Work will need to be conducted around operational crypto contracts, scheduling of Bitcoin micropayments, integration of blockchain nodes in the appliances, decentralized SSL tunnel solutions, OpenStack deployment methodologies, OpenStack SDN and general network architecture, distributed systems architecture, Python application frameworks, including AppEngine and Flask,  UX/UI/design experience with operational software, and developer focused evangelism.</p><p>If you find this opportunity interesting, worthy of your passion and you are looking at a 2-3 month timeframe for a change in your career, please drop me a line.  I'm kordless at stackmonkey dot com.</p><p>Thank you for reading and best of luck in all that you do!  These are exciting times.</p></font>",

Our main industry is K-12 education, but we also have projects in public accountability. One reason our clients prefer working with us is because we build pilot projects to demonstrate success prior to building out larger applications. For us, this means lots of opportunities for building projects from scratch, allowing us to work with the latest and greatest development tools and frameworks.</p><p>You will be working with our team of developers, designers, and subject matter experts to build software that solves real problems. We build in an agile manner with direct user feedback as part of our design/development cycle. You will have the opportunity to mentor others on the team while working with our senior developers. Our current stack leans towards Angular on the client side and Rails on our API server. Our developers are a curious sort though, so we will continue to adjust our stack as new technologies emerge.</p><p>As our front end expert you should be able to create directives, resources, services, controllers, and all the other fun parts of Angular with ease. We use package managers and build systems. We like speeding things up by using Bootstrap or Foundation, so familiarity would be great. Getting the most out of SASS and LESS will also help. Do you like automated testing? Us too! We use Jasmine, Karma, and CircleCi. We also can\u2019t get enough of Github and have a strong code review culture.</p><p>The majority of the team is in Washington, DC but we also have members in NYC, Richmond, VA and Medellin, Colombia.</p><p>If you are interested shoot me an email at job@mobility-labs.com</p></font>",

We're already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here's what's awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it\u2019s time to hire a UX/UI designer.</p><p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they\u2019re flying through their day.</p><p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it\u2019s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.</p><p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we\u2019ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, \u2018make this button blue\u2019 or it could be more elaborate like, \u2018add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,\u2019 or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they\u2019ve noticed small, nice design improvements.</p><p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they\u2019re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.</p><p>List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we\u2019re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.</p><p>We\u2019re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We\u2019re small (3 in-office employees) and we\u2019re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we\u2019re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.\nSend an email to fintechw14@gmail.com telling us about yourself. Include a resume and a portfolio if possible.</p></font>",

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.\nWe have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:<p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts' dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.</p><p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.</p><p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps.

We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.</p><p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!</p><p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don't have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!</p><p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!</p></font>",

We\u2019re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.</p><p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation\u2019s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).</p><p>WHAT WE USE. We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We\u2019ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we\u2019re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don\u2019t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.</p><p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE. We\u2019re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important \u2014 and usually the hardest \u2014 thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.</p><p>WHERE WE\u2019RE AT. Geographically we\u2019re currently at Nuffield Health's offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices), but a move to London (or just possibly Brighton) is likely in the works over the next 6 months. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you\u2019d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.</p><p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk</p></font>",

Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It's like building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of the right color pieces.</p><p>At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we're creative people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow, and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.</p><p>Having the best people doesn't hurt, either. We've got most of them already, and we're looking to find the rest. You can build things with us. What's the catch? We're pretty darn selective.</p><p>To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can work on every part of an application, from the data store to the page\u2013sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.</p><p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target. We're service-oriented, and you should be too.</p><p>Still reading? Please apply! And check out our Web Framework Benchmarks while you're at it.  We pretty much wrote the book on that one.</p><p>Just so you know:</p><p></p><pre><code>   Teams range between 2-6 people\n   Developers are exposed to 3-4 projects per year\n   All development is done on high-performance workstations with 4K displays.

Here is a snapshot of what we're using now:<p></p><pre><code>   Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n   Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n   Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n   Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n   Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n   Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB)\n</code></pre>\nWe don't expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but we do expect you'll learn more about them every day.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to work, please apply here: <a href=\"http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn2</a></p></font>",

We're not very hierarchically organized so typically you'll \"lead by programming\" (and code-reviewing), not by Excel and sticky notes.</p><p>In case you care, our stack is React+TypeScript on the frontend, plus SASS/Foundation for a nice responsive mobile web experience. We do cross-platform C#/Mono on the backend (no Microsoft-lock-in here: current dev team consists of OSX, Linux <i>and</i> Windows users), all data in PostgreSQL, and Docker for deployment. When we grow, we'll probably want to add fancy trendy data stores (like Neo4J or Redis) so you'll have plenty nice new things to work out. We don't really care whether you have particular experience with any of the aforementioned technologies, as long as you have decent full-stack web dev experience.

One of your responsibilities will be to make sure the remote team members don't miss out on what happens in the office, so it would be good if you can be in the office quite frequently. But not necessarily daily, depending on how far away you live: We'll happily hire a good candidate who lives 2 hours away without demanding relocation.</p><p>If you're interested or have any questions, get in touch with me personally, via my HN profile.

In the past year, I've worked with Objective-C (and Swift),\n    Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace.

We want to change the way people eat, while preserving the efficiency and hospitality of a great restaurant experience.</p><p>- Most internet service companies attempt to decrease human interaction through software efficiency. We\u2019re building a company that does the opposite. We think there's something magical about having a chef in your kitchen while you relax and enjoy the company of your guests.</p><p>How we're doing it:</p><p>- We\u2019re committed to code quality and productivity. With those values in mind, we pair program, test drive and practice continuous integration in a Rails environment. We don't work 'startup hours', just normal ones.</p><p>- We're a small team (currently 6 engineers). We rotate often between pairs and across projects.</p><p>- We deploy code whenever we finish a feature. As an example, last week we deployed to production 35 times.</p><p>- We have a collaborative culture where engineers work directly with product managers and designers to find the best solution to user problems.</p><p>- We work out of a townhouse in Gowanus right now, but are moving to Soho very soon.</p><p>Who we're looking for:</p><p>- You're interested in working with Rails and pair programming the majority of the time. You want to write tests for any feature you implement.</p><p>- You're more interested in building a great product and shipping features than you are in figuring out the cleverest solution to a problem.</p><p>- You want to enjoy coming to work each day.</p><p>My name is Dan, I'm an engineer here at Kitchensurfing. If you're interested in learning more, please get in touch: dan AT kitchensurfing DOT com</p></font>",
