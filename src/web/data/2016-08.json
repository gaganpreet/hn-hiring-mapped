[1]<p>There are three attributes you need to select for to identify performing employees in intellectual fields.<p><pre><code>  - General mental ability (Are they generally smart)\n    Use WAIS or if there are artifacts of GMA(Complex work they&#x27;ve done themselves) available use them as proxies.\n\n  - Work sample test. NOT HAZING! As close as possible to the actual work they&#x27;d be doing. Try to make it apples-to-apples comparison across candidates. Also, try and make accomidations for candidates not knowing\n  your company shibboleth.\n\n  - Integrity. The first two won&#x27;t matter if you hire  a sociopath.\n</code></pre>\nThis alone will get you &gt; 65% hit rate [1], and can be done inside of three hours.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 57,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, we\u2019re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out our newest product release here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

There is no waterfall because there aren&#x27;t really handoffs.<p>-We are extremely data driven, every feature or change is a test, we let the data from tests decide.<p>-We try to do everything as an MVP: since we need data for our decisions we prefer to spend as little time as possible building anything.

We&#x27;ve taken a unique approach to changing the food delivery space - a platform to handle an extraordinarily high volume of concurrent deliveries from restaurants that already deliver (i.e. pizza, wings, sandwiches, etc.).  We\u2019re bringing much needed change to local high-volume delivery restaurants that are still doing delivery the way they\u2019ve always done it.  We are backed by some of the best investors in the world, including Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, First Round Capital, SV Angel, and other amazing funds and individuals.<p>Zoomer connects high volume delivery restaurants with independent delivery drivers. Restaurants leveraging the Zoomer platform are able to provide a better &amp; more consistent delivery experience for their customer, which ultimately leads to a stronger bottom line. Independent drivers on the Zoomer platform have the ability to create their own schedule &amp; increase their own efficiency, resulting in more earnings.  And of course, customers receive their orders dramatically faster than the status quo.<p>We\u2019re making key hires to expand our globally distributed core team. You\u2019ll have a ton of impact \u2013 lots of freedom to evolve our processes, systems, partners, platform, stack and apps.

Our team is distributed across the US and Europe.<p>Help us build cutting-edge technical solutions to:<p><pre><code>  - tough logistics problems, quickly routing orders to optimal drivers\n  - on-demand prediction and forecasting models\n  - scalable compute and data infrastructure\n  - multiple mobile apps - for restaurants, drivers, and diners\n  - range of complex real-time frontend interfaces\n </code></pre>\nSome roles we\u2019re currently hiring for:<p><pre><code>  - Logistics technology engineers\n  - Ruby engineers\n  - DevOps engineer\n </code></pre>\nIf this sounds interesting, you can learn more and apply here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zoomerdelivery.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zoomerdelivery.com&#x2F;careers</a>",

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.<p>We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team (mostly MDs) that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs. We&#x27;re currently looking for several senior engineering positions (android, frontend, infra) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>For those interested in some specifics: We have Android, iOS, and web (backbone, react) products. We&#x27;re currently running most of our API on Rails but heavily migrating toward Scala for most of our backend&#x2F;data services.

See, for example, <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-checks.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.octopus.energy&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;05&#x2F;django-elb-health-chec...</a><p>Client-side, we use React and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.<p>We use a Kanban approach to development and employ CircleCI and Atlas to coordinate a continuous deployment pipeline. Engineering standards are high. All code is well tested and thoroughly reviewed.<p>This is a great opportunity for several reasons:<p>* We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, dated and process-heavy - there&#x27;s an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right.<p>* We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we&#x27;ll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.<p>* There&#x27;s a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more disaggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.<p>* You&#x27;ll be working for a company that is helping to tackle climate change. We&#x27;ll be helping move people onto using greener technology and consuming energy from renewable sources. This will all help transition the UK towards a lower carbon future.<p>Apply via talent@octopus.energy",

The global supply chain is one the world&#x27;s largest economic engines, but it struggles to keep up with its own complexity.<p>The manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that make up this complex network are limited by the information they posses. They struggle to track and respond to supply and demand as their product travels from production to consumer. Those who try rely on 40-year-old data standards, lots of manual Excel work, and hordes of human middleware.<p>At Alloy, we\u2019re set to change all this. We provide the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing companies to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand.<p>We are early stage, well funded by leading VCs, and growing. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise software, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We&#x27;re committed to make enterprise software inspiring. We use Google Compute Engine, Postgres, Redis, Python, Java and React, all wrapped in strong design.<p>== About You ==\nYou thrive in a small team where you can build technology from the ground up. You love to pick up new tech, get good at it fast and do something creative with it.<p>You don\u2019t shy away from even the most challenging problems and are relentless in always looking for better solutions. You are self-motivated and enjoy working with others towards a common objective. Building software is the means to an end: you want to change the way an entire industry operates.<p>As an engineer at Alloy, you\u2019ll do any or all of the following:<p>* Model parts of the supply chain and develop features that bring them together<p>* Automate the collection, parsing, and storage of huge volumes of data<p>* Design a flexible but blazing-fast analytics framework that powers instant insights<p>* Build beautiful, easy-to-use apps that our customers love to use<p>* Dive into server provisioning, deployment, automation, and monitoring<p>We would love to hear from you - send me a note at evan@alloy.ai",

Now it&#x27;s time to spread the word. We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>Frontend Engineer: we earn our keep by giving users unprecedentedly fast and easy tools for exploring vast amounts of operational data. That starts with our unique backend query engine, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything without an equally amazing frontend. We&#x27;re building a brand-new web app that adds features while removing complexity, all with an eye to performance. As a ground-up rewrite, there&#x27;s lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>Integration Engineer: an ops visibility tool is only as good as the data it collects. We pride ourselves on collecting everything from logs to system metrics to application metrics to API data, in the whatever environment our customers are using. If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything. You&#x27;ll be playing around with software packages from Apache to Zookeeper, APIs from AWS to, er, Azure. Much of your work will involve adding modules to our Python-based agent. If you&#x27;re interested, there&#x27;s also room to help create dashboards and write guides to help engineers make sense of all the data that $PACKAGE_X generates.<p>DevOps Evangelist: if you&#x27;re passionate about enlightened server operations, appreciate good tools, and would like the chance to bring a great tool to great customers, we should talk. We&#x27;ve had success with meaty posts like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;guides&#x2F;zen-and-the-art-of-s...\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;guides&#x2F;zen-and-the-art-of-s...</a>. and <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scalyr.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;99-99-uptime-9-5-schedule&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.scalyr.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;99-99-uptime-9-5-schedule&#x2F;</a>.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available.

Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services).

Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop.

We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Insanely fast-growing startup. We&#x27;re the fastest startup to reach a billion dollar valuation, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Transparent compensation structure. You can&#x27;t see everyone&#x27;s salary per se, but we have a comp table where you can look up what the salary is for a given position.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

The successful applicant should have strong software development skills and be able to quickly work through helping determine feasibility and mock up of potential ideas but will also potentially be working on production development as well.<p>Flexibility in working hours is important since there is a need to overlap some of the working day with the team in Australia. Initially after starting there would also be a requirement to spend 2-3 months in Australia working directly with our team to get oriented and obtain a good overview of our technologies. Good communication skills are essential as customer interaction is required.<p>The role will require working with high end 3D technologies both developed internally and licensed from third-parties. The visual nature of the results achieved working on our projects is extremely rewarding and there are also lots of interesting toys to play with such as servers crammed with GPUs and remote GPU clusters.

You will be a member of a small team with one engineer focused on continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, and 3 engineers focused on our AWS infrastructure and operations. Working with your team, you will partner with our feature delivery teams to build any automation they need to improve site reliability and velocity.\nYou will be responsible for working on our three biggest site reliability priorities: four 9s high availability, continuous delivery and test automation. You will own the implementation and roadmap planning for improvements to our automation, tools and tests to support these priorities. The majority of your time will be spent building or implementing continuous delivery, test and self-healing automation and supporting tools. You will be a key internal champion for any and all changes to make our production environments more resilient, scalable, and performant.\nYour potential projects will include expanding our CI pipeline across all teams, testing and implementing auto-scaling groups, expanding our test automation (smoke, stress, chaos monkey, etc), and enhancing the velocity of our CI pipeline (parallel tasks, containers, etc).\nThis is not a primary on-call position.

Engineers can focus for long stretches with typically only 2 scheduled meetings a week (one with your team and one with your manager).

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 1 billion questions on our platform.<p>We\u2019re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both Senior Engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as Junior Engineers who are just getting started. We\u2019re looking for Junior Engineers who are eager to learn, who thrive on great mentorship, and who want to work on a mission that makes a difference. We\u2019re looking for Senior Engineers who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they\u2019re right.<p>You can learn more about what it\u2019s like working here through Hardy\u2019s on-boarding blog post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>.<p>If you\u2019re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p><pre><code>  [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\n  [2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\n  [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\n  [4] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</code></pre>",
