We've recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.<p>Of course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I'm working at Google in Madison, they're shocked that there's an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There's fun technical work in Madison, I promise.</p><p>I'm working on a hardware/software co-design project that's attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms. I'm sorry I can't describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.</p><p>The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;</a></p><p>Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you're downvoting this, I'd be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don't care about Madison? Because you don't like big companies? Because you're cynically trying to push your job post above this one? Because you think job postings need bullet points?</p></font>",

We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.</p><p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

Use data to build better processes within the Merchant Relations team. You'll be able to affect the tools we build, the process and more.\n - Research the event business. Read, think and write about the event industry to get insider insights into the business. Of course, you'll also go to a ton of events.</p><p>You have great communication skills, attention to detail and boatloads of creativity. You're that friend who plans for everyone else. Previous sales experience is a huge plus.

New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we\u2019ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We\u2019re hoping you can be the next one.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Mobile Engineer</p><p>Earlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href=\"https://ifttt.com/mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ifttt.com/mobile</a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor's Choice, #1 Productivity). We're looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).</p><p>==================================</p><p>Platform Engineer</p><p>We\u2019re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we\u2019re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.</p></font>",

We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:</p><p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.</p><p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.</p><p>- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -</p><p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.</p><p>We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco.

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.</p><p>One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.</p><p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.</p><p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!</p></font>",

This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.

From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what's actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.</p><p>This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenose\u2019s core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights.

This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world.
