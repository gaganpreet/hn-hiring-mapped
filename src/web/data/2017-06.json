Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

Mike Arpaia here, a Co-Founder of a host endpoint company called Kolide (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolide.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kolide.com</a>) and the original creator of the open-source security software osquery (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;osquery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;osquery</a>) which I put together as a solution to Facebook&#x27;s HIDS problem when I worked there as an engineer.<p>Kolide is building a team of software engineers to work on and contribute to the osquery codebase, which is an open-source C++ project. Open sourced by Facebook in 2014, osquery is an operating system instrumentation and analysis framework which solves a variety of monitoring and instrumentation use-cases. Since its release, osquery has become one of the most popular open source security software projects on all of GitHub with over 9,000 stars and 1,000 forks.<p>The osquery engineering team at Kolide, led by me, the progenitor of the osquery project, will focus on improving the open source codebase for all users of osquery. Engineers will work closely with members of the core osquery team, osquery community members, and other Kolide employees to prioritize features and collaborate on development. Due to the distributed nature of the osquery open source project, this is a completely remote role; Candidates should feel comfortable working independently in a distributed fashion.<p>The following attributes would be true of an ideal candidate:<p>- Extensive experience writing C++<p>- Deep knowledge of the operating system internals of macOS, Linux or Windows<p>- A passion for open source software and community<p>- Strong writing skills and the ability to express ideas via project proposals and design documents<p>- Previous contributions to osquery are definitely a plus, but not strictly required<p>If this sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email at mike@kolide.com!",

Although this group of 4 has a great deal of industry experience, we&#x27;ve only worked together in this capacity for about a year. This means that there&#x27;s still a lot of opportunity and green-field work ahead of us. The position could be described as a Sr. Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. We work with billions of records per day and small hundreds of thousands of (messy!) features. We primarily use Scala&#x2F;Spark and Python, but we employ R, Ruby, plain old SQL and other tools on a regular basis.  We&#x27;re very conscious of the need to keep our DataSci YARN cluster big enough to let us run a lot of experimentation (currently 110+ nodes, 3000+ vcores and ~12 TB memory).<p>We&#x27;d like to find someone familiar with Bayesian systems, Random Forest and other classification. Experience in ad-tech, e-commerce or online retail is a plus, but we strongly favor hiring someone with the right qualities that transcend mere familiarity.<p>More than anything we value sound judgement. It&#x27;s great if you have loads of tools in in your tool belt, but you really have to know when it makes sense to use them.<p>As you get involved with research or optimization work, we want to have confidence that you&#x27;ll have the right intuition about what questions to pursue and what questions to defer. With our high transaction volume, hundreds of unique models in production and hundreds of thousands of potential features, discernment is an essential virtue. We&#x27;ll always have 5x more questions and curiosities than we&#x27;ll have time to chase down. We&#x27;re looking for that person whose judgement is guided by experience and possesses a knack for uncovering valuable, actionable insights.<p>Within our team I lean strongly toward the engineering side of the spectrum, but I&#x27;d be happy to have a conversation about our work. dlarsen@connexity.com If you&#x27;re more comfortable going the typical HR route, I can probably streamline the first phases of communication.",

We&#x27;re a unique company in the intersection of FinTech and GovTech, with a lot of very interesting data problems to solve, the outcome of which becomes a much more optimized system for communities to fund critical civic improvement projects responsibly through a better municipal bond financing process.<p>Our core business model aims to democratize the municipal bond market. Issuers (cities, states, counties, school districts, special districts, etc) will one day be able to borrow more cheaply, quickly, in more convenient precise amounts, with more of the city&#x27;s nominal debt payments flowing back into the community. Investors get direct access to a relatively stable investment product for which the positive impact is a known quantity.<p>We have a substantial investment in our data platform already that we&#x27;re very proud of, but we&#x27;d like to hire top-talent from the Apache Spark community to focus on taking it to the next level.

Everyone has had a manager that makes them want to call in sick. Everyone has had a manager who regularly forces their team to chase their own tail doing meaningless work.<p>Why? Because most managers manage their teams blindly. They don&#x27;t hire, coach and promote based on data. Instead, they make decisions based on their gut. These decisions are made because managers don\u2019t have the data to make smarter, more informed decisions when it comes to managing.<p>Not anymore. At People.ai we\u2019re helping managers make decisions about their team based on data, not intuition. We\u2019re starting with sales teams because they\u2019re a particularly notorious black box. No manager today can definitively say what makes a \u201ctop performer\u201d better than a \u201clow performer.\u201d People.ai is solving this dilemma by making sales management transparent and building the world\u2019s first predictive sales management platform, powered by AI.<p>People.ai was part of the YC S\u201916 batch, launched the product in July of this year and was the first company in the batch to raise a Series A. Less than three months after our launch we\u2019re already being used by sales teams at 50+ blue chip companies including Rubrik, Gainsight, Mulesoft and Optimizely.<p>We have a 10+ person team and are actively looking for Senior Front-end and Back end Engineers to join us. Our team needs someone with full-stack&#x2F;backend development experience as well as a deep background in Python, Linux, AWS, REST APIs and machine learning. Salesforce API experience is a plus!<p>Our Sales team is looking for Enterprise Account Executives and Sales Development Representatives.  A background in on-demand&#x2F;SaaS, CRM, SFA or marketing software sales is strongly preferred. You must have a proven record of consistently meeting and exceeding quota in a fast-paced, competitive sales environment.<p>Our Customer Success team is looking for a Customer Support Manager.  This person will be responsible for managing customer support requests via email, chat and phone and helping to build a world-class customer support organization. Prior experience with Zendesk, Intercom, Jira, Salesforce Service Cloud, etc. is a plus!<p>This isn\u2019t just another job. Your input will be incredibly important as we\u2019re currently shifting from to a microservices architecture. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to make a major impact on a number of our microservices and ML&#x2F;big data infrastructure as we are turning our MVP into a massively scalable product.  Find out what makes us special in this blog, We the People: Why You Should Join People.ai.<p>Work out of our SOMA&#x2F;San Francisco offices.
