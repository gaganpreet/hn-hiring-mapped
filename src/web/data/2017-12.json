We\u2019re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as \u2018adventures\u2019. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.<p>We are backed by one of the UK\u2019s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First. We care about our craft and it\u2019s important to us that you do as well. We\u2019re looking for someone with a couple of years of coding experience under their belt and who\u2019s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you\u2019re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it.\nYou\u2019ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You don\u2019t have to know our whole tech stack but it\u2019s important that you\u2019re willing to learn. You\u2019ll collaborate closely with the CTO as we turn our proof of concept into an MVP ready for production. You\u2019ll build new features, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you.<p>We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually puts you in an unstable spot. Our projects are written in Javascript, React.js, React Native and all use ES6. For this role, Javascript skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We don\u2019t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you\u2019re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.<p>We see coding as a way of communication, it\u2019s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English. Our intention is to enable remote working and flexible working hours as soon as we can. As this is one of our first hires, we need you full-time on-site in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames.\ncrew@cargomate.co.uk",

Ideally, you&#x27;re a full stack coder. But in reality, you probably lean either towards the front or the back end.

To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.<p>* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch.

Our tech stack is moving to Preact&#x2F;Go with some legacy systems still in BackboneJS&#x2F;PHP. We also interface with a wide number of in-house systems written in Perl and Java. We&#x27;re hiring a Senior Engineer with deep O-O PHP experience, ideally some Go, and very strong unit testing experience. You&#x27;ll be doing about 60% front-end work, but if you&#x27;re not strong on the front-end, that&#x27;s fine, we can get you up to speed; experience building complex systems and a strong ability to bring best practices in code and component design is what we really need (and highly applicable across most languages, anyway).  Someone who can help their more junior teammates grow is a top priority.

Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!<p>Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile URL!",

I&#x27;m currently leading our flight tracking team, which develops and maintains a distributed system for tracking flights in parallel, and I&#x27;m in the process of building a machine learning team for the first time ever at the company.<p>This is an opportunity to have a potentially huge impact on machine learning not just at FlightAware but on the aviation industry in general. There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you&#x27;ll find to work on almost anywhere.<p>FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we&#x27;ve partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.<p>FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.<p>You&#x27;d be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we&#x27;re looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won&#x27;t be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, so we&#x27;re ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so. With that said, we&#x27;re willing to consider less experienced candidates with exceptional backgrounds.<p>FA is a small company (currently 70-80 employees), but we&#x27;re not a startup.

We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog!

[4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re looking for engineering managers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they\u2019re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you\u2019re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>",

Amazon started with books, and we&#x27;re starting with billboards. But ultimately we want every single marketer in the world to use AdQuick to do marketing &amp; advertising, across many different verticals, and we intend to be the most customer-centric marketing tech company on the planet.<p>* We&#x27;ve raised $1.3M, led by Garry Tan &amp; Alexis Ohanian (Reddit co-founder).<p>* We&#x27;re ex-Instacart, based in Venice, LA and growing very quickly.<p>* We have repeat buys from Lyft, Instacart, Peloton &amp; more.<p>Our customers are often spending $200k just on one purchase. For them to build targeted, measurable advertising campaigns, their Chief Marketing Officer has a few options:<p>1. Hire a team of people to coordinate across ad spend across multiple channels. Billboards, buses, Facebook, Google, Radio, TV, Reddit and the list goes on.\n2. Go to an ad agency which charges 10-15%.\n3. NEW: Use AdQuick to do all of this better, faster, and cheaper, for just 3.9%.<p>Right now we just handle the outdoor portion, but you see where this is going :) .<p>Our Technical Challenges:<p>1. We have a complex frontend user interface. Users should be able to view 100,000+ markers and transit lines on a map without their browser crawling to a halt. We need to support complex and interesting map visualizations \u2013 layering political voting data, Census data, Foursquare data and more.<p>2. We&#x27;re a search company. AdQuick conducts a search every time the user pans the map. Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.<p>3. We&#x27;re a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We&#x27;ll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.<p>4. Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.<p>5. We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards. Turns out, a lot of people Instagram&#x27;d Drake&#x27;s board. Innovative ROI tools are a core part of our offering.<p>==<p>If you&#x27;re interested, let&#x27;s chat! My email is fahim@adquick.com",

We often work long hours on Saturday, but we have a lot of fun solving problems that involve DNS, Linux, MySQL, bootstrap, iOS, Android, etc..  Founder #2 is interviewing today with one of the big 5 tech companies which means we need another founder who can manage at least one of the following areas: PHP, iOS and Android.  Git experience and Linux skills are important.  We are also interested in a founder who can fully manage a professional Kickstarter&#x2F;Indiegogo&#x2F;Fundly launch.<p>DnsLearning was created to help parents who have young kids whose minds are beginning to be taken over by YouTube&#x27;s deep neural network recommendation system.  In other words, we are trying to restore some balance between how much time a young child spends watching minecraft videos vs the time spent on education sites like DuoLingo and Khan Academy.<p>Our tech works by setting a child&#x27;s computer or tablet to use one of our DNSLearning servers.  After 30 mins, the server will switch the device from &quot;play mode&quot; to &quot;learn mode&quot;.  In learn mode, entertainment sites are blocked.  When the user earns a few points on one of our supported education sites, we will detect this and switch the device back to play mode.  It only takes 3 or 4 mins for a child to earn enough points to get back to play mode.<p>Real marketing will begin once the apps are 100% ready.  Currently we have 130 users that have signed up to use our app manually, using manual DNS config.  Android and Apple apps are very close to being feature complete.<p>A few tech details about us:<p>There are always interesting PHP, C++, MySQL, iOS and Android problems to solve.  For example, how do you uniquely identify different users coming from the same IP address in Android, iOS, or using a manual DNS setup?  For manual DNS, our answer is to use a separate server for multiple users in the same house.  If a customer has IPv6, we are able to assign a unique IP address to every customer.  It is easy to assign hundreds of IP addresses to a single server.  One of the problems we had to solve with IPv6 has to do with knowing, in our C++, what address the incoming UDP packet used to access the server.  When we were working on this problem, the Linux kernel did not save this information.  Last time I checked, Go still does not support this. Ngnix added similar support only a few months before we did.<p>We are looking for a hard working, passionate co-founder WHO BELIEVES LIKE WE DO, that parents deserve technology that is able to guide young minds away from junk grade online entertainment toward, at least for a few minutes, education sites that will help young minds to develop confidence and skills to hopefully provide a stronger knowledge foundation that is critical for their future.<p>support@dnslearning.org",
