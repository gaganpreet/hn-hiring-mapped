It's processing 70% of apps coming through the marketplace, and: converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, is mobile-friendly (20% of apps), sits on robust, scalable infrastructure, etc etc. It was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service) ever hosted on Amazon AWS.</p><p>- Scalable Login System (SLS), the new identity management system for healthcare.gov. Sadly, the main achievement here is that the system is actually up and available, unlike its predecessor.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools\u2019 side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.</p><p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we\u2019re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (15M kids), and 35,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.</p><p>We\u2019re a team of 50 (22 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We\u2019re looking for full-stack engineers who like:</p><p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)</p><p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)</p><p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)</p><p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets</p><p>Check us out at <a href=\"https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack</a>, or check out what we\u2019re working on at <a href=\"https://github.com/clever\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/clever</a>.</p></font>",

DevOps engineers should always be striving to deprecate themselves. However, DevOps is not limited to one team. It is something that is cultural and the responsibility of all engineering.</p><p>About You\nYou love building things.  You are one of those individuals who love making things go faster, graphs go up and being clever about how you do it. Most of what you do on a daily basis is work w/ a diverse set of technologies to brainstorm, automate and refine the Kixer platform.  The stack is built on Spark, Scala, C, C++, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, Redis, Kafka and AWS.</p><p>You have worked with teams on large-scale projects, on multiple different languages and like experimenting with new technologies.  You also understand the realities of CAP theorem and how to design systems in distributed manner across hundreds of servers.</p><p>You get things done. You know how to walk the line of having sound practices while still knowing when something is good enough.  At Kixer, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business.\nYou love setting your own course.  At Kixer, most of the week is \u201cblacked out\u201d for engineering.  Which means no meetings are allowed to be scheduled.  You get to make things happen without someone saying so.</p><p>Things You Might Do\nKixer is a startup, so you\u2019ll get to play in a little bit of everything.  That being said, here are some things you\u2019ll get to lead:\nWork on technologies of all flavors\nScaling the production systems to deal w/ multiple billion impressions\nArchitecture direction, build out, and maintenance of the Kixer platform\nExperimentation with new technologies and techniques to in infrastructure automation\nDevelop tools that make life easier for all of engineering</p><p>About Kixer\nKixer helps app developers get installs through making app recommendations on mobile websites (like TMZ, IGN, and Slashdot).  These recommendations are done through user insights garnered through analysis of massive amounts of data.</p></font>",

Teachers, parents, and other authority figures didn't understand what motivated this behavior, but with the benefit of hindsight I now do.  I wasn't breaking things at all, I was exploring them.  I was learning how they worked by taking them apart and seeing them laid bare.  Sometimes, I'd manage to put them back together and occasionally they'd even work!</p><p>Once, when I was about twelve or thirteen, I took apart a mechanical bedside alarm clock, laid all the gears out organized by size and was promptly grounded for 'destroying' it.  While serving my punishment, I went to work re-assembling it, with one small change.  What had previously been a cheap cardboard clock face was replaced with a piece of translucent contact-paper, with numbers careful stenciled in their proper places.  I loved that clock.  Every morning I'd wake up, see it, and glance deep into its inner workings.  That visual reminder that I'd been curious and unlocked its secrets was how I started mornings throughout my formative years.</p><p>Somewhere along the line, I lost track of where that clock ended up.  It may be gone, but the spirit it demonstrates remains one of my strongest motivators.  I've found no better outlet for this drive to understand the inner workings of things than software security assessment.</p><p>At Matasano, we treat our client's applications like I did that clock.  We take them apart, examine them piece by piece, and arrive at an understanding of what makes them tick.  Only after arriving at this can we find and exploit vulnerabilities.  We slap a clear face on those applications, with the numbers carefully identifying any discovered flaws.  We take them apart and 'break' them, not to be destructive, but to be constructive through understanding them.  Thankfully, we don't even end up grounded. :)</p><p>There's no area of computing that draws on as many skills, but programming, debugging, protocol analysis, reverse engineering, systems administration, network engineering and cryptographic analysis  aren't what make great AppSec consultants.  You need to find what motivates you. For me, being tasked with quickly developing a deep understanding of unfamiliar applications plays right into the mindset that led me to explore that clock.</p><p>So, again I'll ask, what excites you?</p><p>Learn about our hiring process at <a href=\"http://www.matasano.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a> or contact us at careers@matasano.com</p><p>Get a taste for some of what we do at <a href=\"http://www.microcorruption.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.microcorruption.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cryptopals.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cryptopals.com</a></p><p>Check out our blog at <a href=\"http://chargen.matasano.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chargen.matasano.com</a></p><p>~<i>-,._.,-</i>~'`^`'~<i>-,._.,-</i>~'`^`'~<i>-,._.,-</i>~'`^`'~<i>-,._.,-</i>~'`^`'~<i>-,._.,-</i>~</p></font>",

Founded by Kaggle's past president and chief scientist (that's me!), its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors' notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We've raised $5m funding and have a small team of 10 applied machine learning experts.</p><p>If you're interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we're a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges.</p><p>We use a wide range of tools and languages, including AngularJS, React, ES6 / Coffeescript, Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work.\nOur day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world.</p><p>We're working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world.\nWe are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",

We help students save money, and bookstores become and stay relevant, competitive, and transparent.</p><p>Metrics: 350 colleges and universities, serving 4.5 million students, tracking ~200k unique book titles, integrating with 7 vendors &amp; 20 retailers, raising the \"win rate\" for bookstores to 80%, and dropping prices across the board. 23 employees, 3 part-time. 2 dogs. 5 cats. 3 children.</p><p>Profitable. Growing.</p><p>Code: Ruby, Rails, JS (Coffeescript/Backbone), Clojure for Hadoop, MySQL on RDS, AWS w/ Chef. We love experiments and go with what works! We also love making a stable, solid product which is why we have a ton of metrics and a one-click build pipeline.\nWhat's in it for you: A great team and company culture, benefits (even for part time!), a laptop, unlimited books, BART pass, pool table, healthy (and un-) office snacks, great conversation during our yearly company work-cations, and hard, challenging, fulfilling, good (in the public sense) work.</p><p>Message us if: You want to help make education better. You've got strong Rails knowledge (several years worth), solid testing practices, a good head for architecture, and know enough JS to help out on front-end. A stats background, experience with Hadoop and knowledge of scheduling algorithms would be awesome, but not required.</p><p>How to get the job: Write a cover letter that speaks to why this job might fit with you, and how you could help us out. The first step is a phone screen to solve a small programming problem. Then we'll schedule an on-site interview for a few hours, where you'll present for 15 minutes on any topic you'd like, have you walk through some of our code with us, and then deep-dive into the whole stack. Also we'll ask you some historical behavior questions, not logic puzzles. Then we'll make you an offer, and you'll accept and we have a new employee party!</p><p>(And now a personal message from me!)</p><p>I came for the people. I've been at a few companies, I've written a lot of code, and in the end it's who you spend every day with that matters and shapes you.\nThe problems of higher education are many, and this is just one avenue of attack, but it's a fantastic start. Books are simply way too expensive.</p><p>What surprised me the most when joining was that everyone in the company is very kind, that their customers LOVE them, and everyone is highly performing. This doesn't mean that everyone just works long hours and burns out - no, it seems everyone is careful about being at their mental peak and intend to stay that way. This informs every aspect of the culture here: planning, creating, getting feedback, paying off technical debt, retrospectives, always thinking about how to work better and more easily, time off, going to conferences, health care, 401k. Everything.</p><p>It's like this company wants to stay around for a long time or something.</p><p>JOIN US AND MAKE EDUCATION GOOD.</p></font>",

We have roughly 4,000 R&amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world. We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding Blink and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We abstracted away our next-gen server-side infrastructure from specific JS engines and can now run it on top of Spidermonkey or V8 (or any other engine with a similar API) as we please. We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators/arrow functions among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by. (<a href=\"https://github.com/bloomberg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bloomberg</a>)</p><p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.</p><p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 100,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com) are now Node based and the framework used to build them was also recently released on GitHub.</p><p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV was the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance. (Too bad it didn't last... :))</p><p>We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"</p><p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. For anyone going to JSConf in May, I'll be there if you want to chat in person.</p></font>",

Hiring full stack software engineers that love Python &amp; the web.<p>CircleUp is building an online investment marketplace that helps non-tech consumer &amp; retail businesses raise the capital they need to expand. These are companies selling products such as greek yogurt, granola bars, energy drinks, footware, athletic gear, baby food, pet care, cosmetics-- something you might buy in a Whole Foods or Costco. Venture Capital firms don't invest in these categories, and these deals are still too early-stage for traditional private equity. So these entrepreneurs struggle to raise the money that would help them keep up with demand; at the same time, many investors could benefit from the returns of this asset class, if only it could be made easily accessible.</p><p>We have been named one of the Top 5 Most Disruptive companies in Finance by CNBC, one of America's Most Promising Companies by Forbes, and one of the 50 Best Fintech Innovators by KPMG. We are backed by top-tier investors including Google Ventures &amp; Union Square Ventures.</p><p>Our stack is Python (Django) + AngularJS. We use some exciting applications of Machine Learning in Python.\nWe are 11 engineers and growing fast. Half the engineering team is in SF, half is remote (distributed across the US).
