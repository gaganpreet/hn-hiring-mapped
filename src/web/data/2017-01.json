The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 &#x2F; hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them.<p>The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.<p>We currently have a MVP (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com</a>) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.<p>Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80\u00ad-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-\u00ad4.0% | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer</a><p>Contact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com",

If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything.

We&#x27;re building a brand-new web app that adds features while removing complexity, all with an eye to performance. As a ground-up rewrite, there&#x27;s lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>At Scalyr, we&#x27;ve built a log analysis and ops visibility tool that our users rave about, because it smashes expectations for performance and ease of use. We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market.

We are a small team with lots of individual responsibilities and often need to quickly learn a new technology to solve our tasks. You will be working on GUI design (using Python and Qt), Database stuff and data&#x2F;image analysis and visualization, so plenty of different demanding, but always interesting, tasks. You will have an office all for yourself and the beautiful lake Starnberg right in front of you for a quick summertime afterwork or lunchtime swim. Munich is just a 35 minute train ride away.<p>Job description<p>You will be maintaining, extending and refactoring the GUI controlling the BioRam device. You will implement new data processing and analysis methods so that they are accessible from the GUI. Sometimes a new device will have to be integrated in the software, so you\u2019ll have to write a wrapper around the driver.<p>Skills &amp; Requirements<p>+ Our GUI is written in Python and Qt using the pyQt bindings and makes extensive use of twisted for asynchronous communication with devices and the database, so some prior knowledge about object-oriented Python is essential and knowledge of Qt and twisted would be beneficial<p>+ Data are stored in a CouchDB database, so some understanding of NoSQL document stores is helpful. At the least, you should know how to write some Javascript to be able to write new views.<p>+ Data and Image Analysis is mostly done using Python (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and scikit-image), so prior exposure will help you get up to the task much quicker.<p>+ Being a startup, we are a small team that has to handle a lot of different things, so flexibility, quick learning and good team communication skills are essential.<p>Why work with us?<p>+ We acknowledge your creativity and input, due to our lean organizational structure.<p>+ Close customer contacts guarantee diverse projects and never boredom.<p>+ Highly interesting insights in innovative bio-medical research projects.<p>If this attracts your attention, please send us your CV (ideally including a link to your github account, if existing) and cover letter or email k.schuetze at celltool.de for any further questions.",

Because you actually clicked into this, we\u2019re going to assume you&#x27;re a solid PHP developer, experienced with both the old (PEAR, Smarty, pre-OOP, pre-MVC) and the new (Laravel&#x2F;Symfony, composer, PSR, etc).<p>Great! Now let\u2019s talk about some of those as they relate to this position.<p>1.      Big Data \u2013 DRN is the world leader in license plate recognition and currently has more than 5 billion (with a B) rows of license plate and geospatial data.<p>2.      PHP \u2013 We love PHP. We know it has a bad reputation due to a long history of ugliness \u2013 and trust us when we say we have experienced it first-hand. However, it has matured greatly over the past few years and it has allowed us to rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy some amazing applications. We love Laravel and composer, and we have PHP 7 in production.<p>3.      SQL \u2013 Yeah, it\u2019s weird to have PHP connect to SQL Server. And as a PHP developer, you may not have the strongest grasp on SQL Server and all of its idiosyncrasies. But we\u2019re available to help walk you through it.<p>4.      Linux \u2013 Even though we run SQL server, our web servers are fully Ubuntu.<p>5.      Remote \u2013 Let\u2019s dispel with the myth that remote developers can kick their feet back and play Xbox. If you\u2019ve spent any time working remotely, you know the challenges and determination it takes to make it work. We work hard from 8 to 5 and want a developer that will do the same without needless distractions.<p>6.      Git \u2013 We do everything in git and have some great deployment workflows built around it.<p>7.      Security \u2013 Stop here if you have no idea what the OWASP Top 10 is. If you aren\u2019t familiar with how to secure your code against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, then we can\u2019t bring you aboard.<p>What is DRN? Here\u2019s a little spiel about us from our marketing department:<p>&quot;DRN is the dominant provider of license plate recognition and vehicle location data to the automotive finance industry.  DRN\u2019s data is responsible for the recovery of more than 550,000 vehicles valued at $4 billion. With its position firmly established in the automotive finance market, DRN is now expanding into other markets including insurance, enterprise&#x2F;government, and digital marketing industries.&quot;<p>Learn more about us at drndata.com.<p>If you\u2019re interested, send us a link to your Github or Bitbucket profile along with your resume or equivalent.

Some of our best-known are SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

By completing job simulations, instead, the best candidates stand out regardless of their educational background or years of experience. Our customers love it.\nOver the last year, we&#x27;ve added fantastic customers like Uber, Fidelity Investments, Upwork, Thumbtack, Zillow. We need to expand our account management team to ensure all of their needs are met.<p>Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll do as an account manager:<p>- Own a set of key accounts and ensure that they are delighted with Interviewed and are achieving success in hiring by using us. That means proactively evaluating their hiring process for better strategies, responding to questions and requests, and frequent check-ins.<p>- Onboard new accounts by building out their hiring pipeline (jobs, assessments, automation, correspondence templates) and training new users.<p>- Ensure job candidates are having a smooth experience by troubleshooting issues and providing guidance to job seekers on behalf of our customers.<p>- Create assessments by researching and writing scripts for new assessments, proofreading and editing for other members of the team, and updating FAQs and macros.<p>We don&#x27;t really care about your background because, after all, we are trying to help companies move away from traditional hiring. Some of the best people we&#x27;ve worked with came from recruiting, sales, and the arts. They have the dedication, endurance, and above all, enthusiasm needed to succeed in a dynamic, multinational tech company. If you are a great communicator, work fast, and are willing to take risks, we\u2019d love to talk!<p>Our hiring process uses our own product and it usually only takes about one week from first contact to final decision!<p>Round 1: We&#x27;ll send you an invitation to complete some questions online. These are designed to show us how well you communicate in writing (really important for a remote team).<p>Round 2: We&#x27;ll schedule a short phone call to get to know you and let you ask questions about the role. We&#x27;ll also invite you to a 1-hour work sample (a mini project) that is a simplified version of something you will do if hired.<p>Round 3: We&#x27;ll schedule a day that&#x27;s convenient for you to take on the role of account manager. You&#x27;ll work with the rest of the team on three projects that will produce concrete deliverables by the end of the day. The projects are challenging but fun. This is your chance to see what we do, up close, and get to know the rest of the team. We provide a stipend to thank you, too.<p>Our generous compensation package will include stock options, medical and dental insurance, a 401K plan, and paid vacations.<p>Please email me directly at daniel@interviewed.com or you can see all our openings at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internal.interviewed.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internal.interviewed.com</a>",
