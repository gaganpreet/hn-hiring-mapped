We&#x27;re building a brand-new web app that adds features while removing complexity, all with an eye to performance. As a ground-up rewrite, there&#x27;s lots of opportunity for you to have a significant impact. If you care about user experience, enjoy great engineering, and want to join an experienced team where you can really stretch yourself, we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>At Scalyr, we&#x27;ve built a log analysis and ops visibility tool that our users rave about, because it smashes expectations for performance and ease of use. We offer the equity, influence, and fun of an early-stage company, with stability, great pay, and a low-stress culture. We have great backers, strong traction, and an 11-digit target market. I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say this is my favorite so far.<p>If this sounds like fun, check out the link below, or drop us a line at jobs@scalyr.com.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scalyr.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;agent-engineer</a>",

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (65,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, we\u2019re looking for a security-focused software engineer: a creative thinker who\u2019d be excited to help keep students\u2019 data safe.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our recent product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.<p>It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re big believers in functional programming; OCaml, a statically typed functional language, is our primary development platform. Jane Street\u2019s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun.\nWe\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code? Visit Open Source @ Jane Street (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;</a>), where you&#x27;ll find several OCaml libraries that we&#x27;ve released into the wild. These form the basis for all of our software, and we hope they make life better for some non-Jane-Street OCaml developers as well.<p>If you&#x27;re not yet convinced, feel free to poke around our benefits page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;</a>).

I have only positive things to say about working here. The people are intelligent and helpful, interesting problems to solve and the work hours are unbelievably sane. The company is strongly data driven and very dynamic, which was one of its biggest charms for me. Amsterdam is not a bad place to be either :) The Dutch government also gives a tax break through the 30% ruling to non-dutch people.The work environment is very international and everybody speaks fluent English. The relocation process is also very finely tuned through years of experience of doing this.<p>If you have any other questions about the company or the hiring process or you would like me to refer you, please feel free to send me an email at siddharthsarda01 at gmail.com (Email also in my profile at Hacker news).

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider. We have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>Our stack is native Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C), our API is served in a Ruby on Rails monolith and Scala services, on top of MySQL, Cassandra, ElasticSearch and Spark. We are especially focusing on expanding our frontend team as we see significant growth on that side of the product. We are mostly Backbone + React, although some more complex state we are moving to Redux. It&#x27;s a very exciting time for the frontend, as we are planning to grow both in scale in terms of patient populations, as well as product use cases that require diverse interactions. It is super rewarding to see our product affect real people&#x27;s lives and the opportunity to reinvent this massive industry is enormous.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a> Also feel free to reach out to me at nam@wellframe.com!",

Because you actually clicked into this, we\u2019re going to assume you&#x27;re a solid PHP developer, experienced with both the old (PEAR, Smarty, pre-OOP, pre-MVC) and the new (Laravel&#x2F;Symfony, composer, PSR, etc).<p>Great! Now let\u2019s talk about some of those as they relate to this position.<p>1.      Big Data \u2013 DRN is the world leader in license plate recognition and currently has more than 5 billion (with a B) rows of license plate and geospatial data.<p>2.      PHP \u2013 We love PHP. We know it has a bad reputation due to a long history of ugliness \u2013 and trust us when we say we have experienced it first-hand. However, it has matured greatly over the past few years and it has allowed us to rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy some amazing applications. We love Laravel and composer, and we have PHP 7 in production.<p>3.      SQL \u2013 Yeah, it\u2019s weird to have PHP connect to SQL Server. And as a PHP developer, you may not have the strongest grasp on SQL Server and all of its idiosyncrasies. But we\u2019re available to help walk you through it.<p>4.      Linux \u2013 Even though we run SQL server, our web servers are fully Ubuntu.<p>5.      Remote \u2013 Let\u2019s dispel with the myth that remote developers can kick their feet back and play Xbox. If you\u2019ve spent any time working remotely, you know the challenges and determination it takes to make it work. We work hard from 8 to 5 and want a developer that will do the same without needless distractions.<p>6.      Git \u2013 We do everything in git and have some great deployment workflows built around it.<p>7.      Security \u2013 Stop here if you have no idea what the OWASP Top 10 is. If you aren\u2019t familiar with how to secure your code against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF, then we can\u2019t bring you aboard.<p>What is DRN? Here\u2019s a little spiel about us from our marketing department:<p>&quot;DRN is the dominant provider of license plate recognition and vehicle location data to the automotive finance industry.  DRN\u2019s data is responsible for the recovery of more than 550,000 vehicles valued at $4 billion. With its position firmly established in the automotive finance market, DRN is now expanding into other markets including insurance, enterprise&#x2F;government, and digital marketing industries.&quot;<p>Learn more about us at drndata.com.<p>If you\u2019re interested, send us a link to your Github or Bitbucket profile along with your resume or equivalent.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We\u2019re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago. We\u2019re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they\u2019re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you\u2019re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a>\n[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a>\n[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a>\n[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>",

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have many offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming. Some of our best-known are SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Palo Alto.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>-- <i>Applying</i><p>For engineers, the pipeline is approx: r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review, phone call, tech screen, pairing interviews.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

By completing job simulations, instead, the best candidates stand out regardless of their educational background or years of experience. Our customers love it.\nOver the last year, we&#x27;ve added fantastic customers like Uber, Fidelity Investments, Upwork, Thumbtack, Zillow. We need to expand our account management team to ensure all of their needs are met.<p>Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll do as an account manager:<p>- Own a set of key accounts and ensure that they are delighted with Interviewed and are achieving success in hiring by using us. That means proactively evaluating their hiring process for better strategies, responding to questions and requests, and frequent check-ins.<p>- Onboard new accounts by building out their hiring pipeline (jobs, assessments, automation, correspondence templates) and training new users.<p>- Ensure job candidates are having a smooth experience by troubleshooting issues and providing guidance to job seekers on behalf of our customers.<p>- Create assessments by researching and writing scripts for new assessments, proofreading and editing for other members of the team, and updating FAQs and macros.<p>We don&#x27;t really care about your background because, after all, we are trying to help companies move away from traditional hiring. Some of the best people we&#x27;ve worked with came from recruiting, sales, and the arts. They have the dedication, endurance, and above all, enthusiasm needed to succeed in a dynamic, multinational tech company. If you are a great communicator, work fast, and are willing to take risks, we\u2019d love to talk!<p>Our hiring process uses our own product and it usually only takes about one week from first contact to final decision!<p>Round 1: We&#x27;ll send you an invitation to complete some questions online. These are designed to show us how well you communicate in writing (really important for a remote team).<p>Round 2: We&#x27;ll schedule a short phone call to get to know you and let you ask questions about the role. We&#x27;ll also invite you to a 1-hour work sample (a mini project) that is a simplified version of something you will do if hired.<p>Round 3: We&#x27;ll schedule a day that&#x27;s convenient for you to take on the role of account manager. You&#x27;ll work with the rest of the team on three projects that will produce concrete deliverables by the end of the day. The projects are challenging but fun. This is your chance to see what we do, up close, and get to know the rest of the team. We provide a stipend to thank you, too.<p>Our generous compensation package will include stock options, medical and dental insurance, a 401K plan, and paid vacations.<p>Please email me directly at daniel@interviewed.com or you can see all our openings at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internal.interviewed.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internal.interviewed.com</a>",
