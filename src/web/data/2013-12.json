We're a small, 50-person nonprofit tech startup making a big difference in the world. A few weeks ago, we found this great story through the fascinating blog \"Humans of New York\" \u2013 please take a moment to read it:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64412654576/i-struck-up-a-conversation-with-him-and-he\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64412654576/i-struck-up-...</a></p><p>This is just one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives that we've transformed, and there are thousands more we don't hear about.</p><p>Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of math practice exercises. Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.</p><p>This gives us the ability to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. As I write this we're running dozens of A/B tests to learn what we can do to make people learn more, from testing how review scheduling affects accuracy to simply testing different teaching styles.</p><p>Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business \u2013 though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.</p><p>---</p><p>I'm going to put in a special plug for mobile: Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two people (me and one other person) working on our apps right now. Our iOS app is fairly basic, but it already has a few million downloads. We want to make it awesome. If you're a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please</i> reach out. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.</p><p>We're hiring engineers (web, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. Oh, and if you want to have a great summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.</p><p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!) or feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org with any questions.</p><p>[1]: <a href=\"http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learning\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...</a></p><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a></p></font>",

Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.</p><p>Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.</p><p>DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.</p><p>--</p><p>We're looking for someone to help us with a new product/revenue stream we're going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We're also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.</p><p>I'm Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.</p><p>I'm looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2/PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I'd like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is also a plus. We use Git and I'd expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.</p><p>You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don't test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.</p><p>I do interviews similarly to the way they're done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you're looking for in a position I'd have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they're interested in. I don't do conference room whiteboard programming.</p><p>I don't have a degree, and I don't expect you to have one, either. I don't necessarily care about how long you've been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you're capable and can show it, I'm interested.</p><p>You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.</p><p>Cheers.</p></font>",

As a result, we're looking to expand our engineering team. We are looking for full-stack engineers, back-end data engineers, and front-end data visualization interaction designers.</p><p>If you're focused on the backend, you should have experience with high write performance DBs (e.g. Redis, Cassandra), large-scale log analysis (e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Hive), and big distributed cloud systems (e.g. &gt;20 node cloud deployments). That will mean you'll hit the ground running here.</p><p>For the front-end, you should know modern web and mobile design principles and be particularly excited by d3.js and its associated ecosystem.</p><p>You'd be joining the company at a great time. Our engineering team is still small enough that we feel like an elite task force, but unlike two years ago, we are making millions in revenue and have a ridiculous amount of data to draw insight out of on behalf of our customers.</p><p>You should be an expert in a mainstream programming language, preferably Python or JavaScript. You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.</p><p>Also, if you happen to be an experienced software engineer who wants to end up in a role with a mixture of product management, customer interaction, and individual contributions to the code, we have just the position for you. Let us know -- we're looking for you.</p><p>If you join us, you'll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media. Our software aggregates data on over 5 billion pageviews per month of traffic, and we work with major media companies as customers, such as The Atlantic, Arstechnica, Mashable, The New Republic, MIT Technology Review, and many more.</p><p>Apply by sending a (short!) cover letter to work@parsely.com. Mention this HN post and say you're looking for Andrew.</p><p>Include links to online portfolio, Github, LinkedIn, or any similar services, if you have them. If you have a Python code example that you think expresses your Python coding style, that would also be a good thing to send along (as plain attachment, Github Gist, or similar).</p></font>",

SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.</p><p>We're looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we've got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.</p><p>So far this year, we've built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive's gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We're currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].</p><p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don't realize it.

Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines.

That's a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there's a lot to it. It says that we think they're smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they're passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.</p><p>Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They're largely modeled after Google interviews (there's a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we've had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the \"getting the right answer\" not being the interesting part of the interview).</p><p>Specifically - We're looking for:</p><p>Backend Developers:\nYou're a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we're building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we're looking for people who care about performance. A lot.</p><p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you're willing to learn. If you don't know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.</p><p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they're probably the only folks around who might get the intricacies of what you're excited about)</p><p>We're looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you're a Senior Engineer - you've worked in server-side code for a few years. You've scaled to thousands or millions of users. You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.</p><p>If you're a Junior engineer, you love to code and you're good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited. (New grads please apply!)</p><p>Android and IOS engineers:</p><p>You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience. You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.</p></font>",

Maker has an established reputation for guiding content creators in maximizing views and courting brands. Additionally, the Technology group within Maker innovates with world-class web engineering and design practices to produce high-quality apps and tools that connect content with eyeballs and usher content creators to new levels of mastery.</p><p>What does Maker build? We develop talent-facing web applications at high scale that connect YouTube content creators with each other, with our channel-management pros, and with tech such as ad optimization and alternative distribution targets. We also build internal web apps, APIs, and a handful of public-facing video/content sites for our top talent. Here are some of the technologies we use:</p><p>Frontend:\nCSS3 - cross-browser  positioning, efficient selectors, reflow vs repaint, transitions/animations.\nJS - able to avoid libraries and write native code for Ajax requests, DOM traversal, event binding/delegation, ready states. Constructors and lambdas.\nHTML5 - familiar with Web Sockets, Local Storage, Session Storage. Bonus: Web Components.\nLibraries: Bootstrap/Foundation, Knockout/Ember/Angular, jQuery/Zepto, Underscore, Grunt.js, SASS/LESS, CoffeeScript\nOpen Source: has released at least a few personal projects. Bonus: popular/starred repos.\nBackend: Node/Express, Python/Django,, Ruby/Rails, NginX\nTesting: CircleCI, Cucumber, Mocha\nDeployment: Capistrano, Fabric, Dotcloud, AWS, CloudFlare\nVirtual Machines: Vagrant, Docker\nSearch: CloudSearch, ElasticSearch, Lucene\nSQL: Mysql, RedShift / Postgres\nNoSQL: Redis, Memcache, MongoDB, Neo4j, Hive/Hadoop, Cassandra/Riak\nLinux: Bash/Shell scripting</p><p>Want more reasons to work at Maker?

We use APIs to cross-connect our projects with ease, which also enables us to use different languages in different projects.\nFlexible work hours - come in as early or late as you want, as long as your total hours are on par with your peers; what really matters is the quality and quantity of your code commits.\nCode intelligently - We hack, but we also care about sharing code with each other, so we talk about readability and complexity, we develop all modules as though they'll one day be open-sourced, and we believe in small tools used cleverly, at scale.\nOpen Source friendly-  Besides using mostly open-source tools, we've open-sourced several internally developed tools on <a href=\"https://github.com/MakerStudios/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/MakerStudios/</a>, and more are coming.\nGreat benefits - We have amazing investors and we want healthy, enthusiastic employees, so we offer our engineers a highly competitive salary, top-notch health/dental/vision coverage, 401(k), and stock options.</p><p>Inquiries:  geoffrey.plitt@makerstudios.com</p></font>",

The industry is ripe for innovation! We're building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.\nI know 'app for laundry' is a tech clich\u00e9 right now, but we're definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we're solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I'm Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.</p><p>We're looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.</p><p>We're also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and 'growth hacking.' We're building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business. Please see a job description at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1dLJigo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/1dLJigo</a> - The sky's the limit!</p><p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.

At Layer, we\u2019re on a mission to deliver it. We\u2019re hiring iOS, Android, backend, Web and systems engineers, as well as designers.</p><p>We have problems to solve that you\u2019ll have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Here\u2019s why:</p><p>We\u2019re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  We\u2019ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.</p><p>We\u2019re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.</p><p>We\u2019re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.</p><p>We\u2019re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.</p><p>We care about documentation: <a href=\"https://layer.com/docs/ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://layer.com/docs/ios</a>.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.</p><p>We care about design.  We won\u2019t be releasing our own apps - that\u2019s up to our customers - but we\u2019ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.</p><p>We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don\u2019t have the keys we can\u2019t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)</p><p>Today we're a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We\u2019re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.</p><p>We\u2019re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. We\u2019ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.</p><p>Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com</p></font>",

We're looking for another smart person to join our team in the West Loop of Chicago. This candidate should enjoy learning new things and solving hard problems.</p><p>We work almost exclusively with open source software and we're not shy about jumping into third-party code to figure things out.  You should be motivated to submit pull requests and hunt down project committers on Twitter and IRC when you're stuck.</p><p>Some of our favorite day-to-day technologies include Groovy, Grails, Elasticsearch, Drools, MongoDB, Backbone.js/Marionette, CoffeeScript and Puppet.</p><p>Our clients range from small and scrappy startups to large hospital networks and software as a service providers. Historically, most of the stuff we've worked on has not been public-facing: it's either guarded behind the client's firewall, neatly tucked away as a library or jammed into the minds of the developers we've mentored. But we're starting to diversify from \"behind-the-scenes\" work to more early-stage product development.</p><p>Fundamentally, we like to work on tools that helping people make better decisions. This can take the form of a search engine to help people find interesting stuff to do on a Saturday night, a complex workflow management system for evaluating health insurance claims or a matchmaking and scheduling system to help people book face-to-face meetings at conferences.</p><p>We're looking for generalists who can quickly go from problem to working solution and communicate effectively with our peers and clients along the way. While we have a very strong technical stack already, you don't expect new hires to be an expert in everything right away.  In general, though, we're looking for people with the following qualifications:</p><p>* One or more fun languages: Ruby, Python, Groovy, Clojure, PHP, CoffeeScript, etc.</p><p>* One or more boring languages: Java, C++, C#, etc.</p><p>* One or more web frameworks: Grails, Rails, Django, SpringMVC, Play, CakePHP, etc.</p><p>* One or more databases: SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL, we like it all.</p><p>* HTML, CSS, JavaScript and at least one framework</p><p>* Git, or a colorful excuse for not knowing it.</p><p>* The typical software development toolchain: text editors, IDEs, step debuggers, issue trackers, etc.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more, please email jobs@spantree.net to  set up a Google Hangout.</p></font>",
