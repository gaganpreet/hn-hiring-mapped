We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.</p><p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total.

We recently raised an 18 million series B! We're growing, and with that comes scaling challenges. But it's all part of the fun. We have a great team and a great environment that focuses on customers and product development. When I'm working on product stuff, I get to collaborate with product / UX / support people day to day to build a product that meets a real business need, and makes everyone happy. But when I just need to bang out some code, people leave me alone. When I'm working on platform or architectural stuff, I get great advice and feedback from my coworkers. Expressing opinions and having discussion is encouraged. Friday afternoons are refactoring / innovation day to scratch your good code itch. Work / life balance is great.

We use a lot of node.js, javascript, python, and django.</p><p>You love being a substantial contributor and are interested in the \u201cfull stack\u201d of technologies from details of server configuration, back-end, front-end, and mobile platforms. You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.</p><p>Likeable Local offers an integrated software solution that allows small businesses to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and Twitter.
