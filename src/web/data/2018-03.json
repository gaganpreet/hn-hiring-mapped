We depend on privacy and anonymity tech, including Monero [XMR]. Monero has lofty goals and powerful privacy claims that fall short in actual operation.<p>As an example: All network communications are unencrypted which allows a passive adversary to easily de-anonymize many transactions. Instead: Monero should be encrypted and easily integrate with Tor to hide user activity.<p>Contract 1: We desire an engineer to contribute to the Monero open source project. This includes adding encryption between nodes, reducing wallet metadata leakage, and integrating Tor into both the client [easy] and the node software [more challenging].<p>Contract 2: We need someone to write a simulator and improve blockchain explorer tools to determine how well Monero&#x27;s privacy claims truly hold up. To-date there is no public research on fundamental aspect of Monero. We want to be able to have answers to the questions of how private a user becomes when using Monero. How often must a user send money to themselves [churn] to effectively hide among X users? We want to make proposals to change the Monero network parameters to improve privacy and have the evidence to make the case.<p>All work will be published openly and you can take the credit with a note that PinkDate is the sponsor. You should be comfortable engaging with community and defending design decisions and research.<p>Note: PinkDate is an extrajurisdictional company and pays contractors in cryptocurrencies as a transfer mechanism.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper\u2019s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis\u201d. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing. Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. We\u2019ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

We&#x27;ve over 250 college partners, and users in 1 of 2 high schools in the US. Many of our students earn tens-of-thousands of dollars for college. The coolest part of our platform is how it educates students about the possibility of college in the first place. Many of our users are first-generation college attendees, or minority or low-income students.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent VICE Impact article about us: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;impact.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;ne3yvm&#x2F;students-earned-dollar1-billion-in-college-scholarships-using-their-smartphones\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;impact.vice.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;article&#x2F;ne3yvm&#x2F;students-earned...</a><p>If you&#x27;re an engineer looking to work with other smart and passionate individuals on the mission of helping all high school students achieve their college ambitions, get in touch!

That makes it the #3 cause of death, just behind heart disease and cancer (goo.gl&#x2F;zntNUd). This is a major societal catastrophe - and it needs to be fixed. Part of the solution is the long-overdue modernization of our nation&#x27;s health IT infrastructure. This is CareEvolution&#x27;s mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to fill a technical communicator role to manage building and maintaining our internal and external documentation, to write journal articles, to do some wiki management, to produce video tutorials etc.  A high degree of technical expertise is required, as are excellent writing and communication skills and a background in health IT.  This role also likely entails managing customer questions and requests as it relates to documentation - and executing on them. The ideal candidate will have expertise in at least some of the following: HTML, XML, basic Git, basic graphic design, basic SQL, understanding and using REST and other web services, basic video editing and production.  We don&#x27;t expect all of those skills... it&#x27;s just that we&#x27;re not sure how best to communicate what we need to communicate - that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re looking for someone.<p>We&#x27;re a small team - still under 100 people (and all technical!) - but our platform manages health data for over 130 million people.<p>Check out our company page on <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;companies&#x2F;careevolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;companies&#x2F;careevolution</a><p>Visit our website at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careevolution.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.careevolution.com&#x2F;</a><p>Submit resumes (PDF please!) to resume@careevolution.com .<p>Note: this job is open to US Residents only.

I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you&#x27;ll find to work on almost anywhere.<p>FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we&#x27;ve partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.<p>FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.<p>You&#x27;d be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we&#x27;re looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won&#x27;t be a cog in the machine.

Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it.

Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training&#x2F;time investment doesn&#x27;t make as much sense from your end or ours. When each interview is done, you&#x27;re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S. We&#x27;re also hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers, dev managers, and a product manager right now; for those we generally prefer local (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation.

We also do predictive modelling for demand (not just in call centres: retail as well).<p>We are a well-funded startup with a long runway to support our current 20 staff.

We have mature management (two ex-googlers are on the management team, including the former Australian general manager; the rest of the executive team have held senior roles across the banks, successful startups and a variety of other major corporations). You get the stability and mature culture of a large corporate job, but the interesting work and dynamic environment of a startup.<p>We have a team of data scientists already; I&#x27;m looking to hire one more, preferably with skills in computer vision.<p>I am looking to hire around 3-5 software developers to take on various projects.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is \u201cboutique consulting firm\u201d as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about 6 months. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We&#x27;re looking to get one final person in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you.<p>We are incredibly selective (who isn&#x27;t?) and we are really quite small. We&#x27;ve blogged about our hiring process and we&#x27;ve blogged about our funnel. The reality is we&#x27;ve optimized our hiring process to filter first, before a call. We&#x27;re sorry this is the case; it would be really nice to meet everyone, but we simply don&#x27;t have the time to do that while also working on our business. We try to be as transparent as we can be about our process, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you we&#x27;d love to hear from you when we&#x27;re bigger and having a recruiting division who will be able to do a call first approach. We have a vision of a product but we don&#x27;t have one yet, so we can&#x27;t point you to it. Sorry!<p>Also, we&#x27;re forthright about this (see the first line of this post) but we really and truly only hire employees authorized to work in the US. We&#x27;re not large enough to want to deal with non-US tax jurisdictions, and we&#x27;re not looking for 1099 contractors at this time.<p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we don&#x27;t. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtforme.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builtforme.tech</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.builtforme.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.builtforme.tech</a><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;builtforme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;builtforme&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a>",

We count on Software Designers to inspire teams of the possibilities enabled by software, computing, and programmatic thinking, providing unorthodox ways to push design. They first-hand enact our mission of humanizing technology: starting from first principles to ask the right questions, of people, technology, and systems.<p>One or more below could be your focus areas:<p>- Physical&#x2F;Digital. You\u2019re a Creative Technologist who works with software and hardware to create connected installations, experiences, and augmented objects. Your skills may include electrical engineering, micro-controllers, sensors, creative coding, or robotics.<p>- Emergent Interactions. You\u2019re a pioneering Software-meets-Interaction Designer who works with emergent edge technology to explore new interactions at the frontier of what\u2019s possible. You\u2019ve dabbled, but have focus in a specialization ranging from computer vision, to chatbots, to augmented&#x2F;mixed reality, to blockchain.<p>- Digital Product. You\u2019re a rare user-centered Engineer&#x2F;Designer&#x2F;Unicorn. You bring strong front-end skills with full stack potential to craft product, aligning user needs and client objectives. You understand web or device-native development, along with the iterative agile dev process, and how to position products for scale and impact. You have a secret crush on business design.<p>- Digital Immersion. You\u2019re an Illusion Technologist, crafting intangibles like \u201cfeeling,\u201d via code. You guide people across the uncanny valley by working with software to create immersive experiences, games, or interactive narratives. You can reach deep into the inner nature of physics and computer graphics, and apply that to 2D&#x2F;3D or VR, with tools like Unity.<p>- Computational Design. You\u2019re a Generative Technologist. A pattern recognizer. A problem classifier. You works with algorithms or simulations to crack challenges that humans alone can\u2019t compute. Your toolkit of tactics may include procedural design, machine learning, or neural networks.<p>As a Software Designer in Palo Alto, we provide the opportunity for you to: - Participate in the full design process, from talking with users to identifying potential opportunities, to delivering a great software product. - Solve problems in a broad set of domains, ranging from health, consumer technology, and mobility. - Explore and develop concepts with emerging technologies, such as new user interaction technologies, computer vision, or machine learning.<p>Want to know more about this role?

We have two main divisions: Pivotal Labs and R&amp;D.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are rigorously agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code outside-in. Our product managers are focus on value and validation, our designers keep the user foremost in our minds. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well. We have a growing data science practice. More broadly our services division includes field, data science, educators, app replatformers, even I lose track.<p>Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?<p>-- <i>R&amp;D</i> is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service &amp; Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire &#x2F; Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse CI. We&#x27;re adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team.

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
