We have over 70 million US members and are a true mission-oriented business, a rare case where our incentives are aligned with our users - we succeed by helping our members attain financial progress.<p>We&#x27;re growing very rapidly right now, and have tons of opportunities for people to solve hard problems while helping people grow their financial progress. Let&#x27;s unpack that:<p>Opportunities: On the backend, we&#x27;re transitioning to a microservice based environment based on Scala&#x2F;JVM, using Twitter-born libraries such as Finagle. We&#x27;re also unifying our data model into GraphQL to help bring separate but related services and verticals together. On the frontend, we&#x27;re rebuilding our various components in React using modern web technologies while still keeping an emphasis on stability. We also have data teams using BigQuery and Kafka to injest and understand.  We&#x27;re also hiring security engineering, test engineering, machine learning engineering  and basically any other position you might expect to find at an optimistically growing company. All of that combined means that whatever your technical passion, we probably have a spot for you to contribute!<p>Financial Progress: Honestly, this is the best part. I know working at every company has its ups and downs, but at the end of the day, being able to say &quot;My work helps people. When they thrive, so do we.&quot; is fantastic. When our users grow financially, they start migrating to better financial products to suit their new needs, and we want to be there the whole way to guide them.<p>We have a lot to do, and a lot to solve, and we&#x27;d like help! \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creditkarma.com&#x2F;careers</a>",

If it\u2019s not local, it\u2019s not on Localeur.<p>Since launching Localeur in 2013, our mission has been to help people experience local wherever they go. We are passionate about helping people feel like they belong and experiencing the true culture of a city, rather than the tourist traps and chains. Quality, authenticity and integrity are paramount to us achieving this mission.<p>We are looking for a great JavaScript developer who is proficient with React.js. Your primary focus will be on developing user interface components and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. You will coordinate with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. Therefore, a commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design and quality product is important.<p>Please send any resumes and sample apps to moody@localeur.com",

We think about online learning in a vertically integrated way, from the actual learning content and the product all the way to job preparation. Students with no programming and just high school math backgrounds have gone from 0 to job ready and have gotten jobs at companies like SpaceX, and our NPS is around 60.<p>We don&#x27;t believe in skimming the surface of concepts so that students just know what to type. We build intuition around complicated ideas like random forests from the ground up. We walk students through building their own algorithms, so we can help them understand the tradeoffs and limitations of techniques. We help students build projects, so they can solidify their knowledge and get real-world experience.<p>While so far we&#x27;ve mostly focused on teaching data science through Python, we&#x27;re looking for someone to help us extend and enhance our R content. This involves writing instructional content, creating projects, thinking about how to improve how we teach, mentoring students directly, and getting feedback from students to improve our teaching methods. If you have:<p>- experience writing R code (whether on the job or your own packages)<p>- experience writing technical data science content<p>- a strong a data science foundation<p>- a deep interest in teaching<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who shares our mission of giving people access to high quality education at a low cost.

We started Underdog.io because we experienced the pains associated with (1) hiring while working at top startups and (2) looking for new opportunities.<p>Our platform is currently live in SF and NYC. We work with over 300 awesome companies. Quality is key to our model -- we turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network. We&#x27;ve proudly bootstrapped and profitable.<p>As we scale, we\u2019ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don\u2019t receive as much unsolicited outreach from recruiters. Job search is organized, and talented candidates have more high-quality options.<p>We use Python&#x2F;Flask, Javascript&#x2F;Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, and AWS. We&#x27;re also working on a project in Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra.

From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone screen -&gt; technical interview -&gt; code project -&gt; product interview -&gt; offer letter!<p>Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile URL!",

Everyone has had a manager that makes them want to call in sick. Everyone has had a manager who regularly forces their team to chase their own tail doing meaningless work.<p>Why? Because most managers manage their teams blindly. They don&#x27;t hire, coach and promote based on data. Instead, they make decisions based on their gut. These decisions are made because managers don\u2019t have the data to make smarter, more informed decisions when it comes to managing.<p>Not anymore. At People.ai we\u2019re helping managers make decisions about their team based on data, not intuition. We\u2019re starting with sales teams because they\u2019re a particularly notorious black box.
