The role is highly independent and will be working closely with our cofounders on all things backend. We have a strong engineering culture with an extremely capable and experienced team.

We are looking for an engineer and developer of the same caliber to join our team to take Highrise to the next level.<p>The role is fast-paced and independent, with a focus on results rather than on direct oversight or management.

Stellenticket is a completely self funded TU Berlin startup from 2009, being profitable since the beginning. We develop and provide web software as a service for mostly German universities (B2B). Our two main products, Stellenticket Jobportals and Congeno (a CRM) are already in use in production since 2010 (Jobportals) and 2016 (Congeno), but are still constantly improved. Besides those two projects we use several smaller Rails apps ourselves to organize our work (like a simple time tracker and a task manager). We also have some other products in our pipeline where we need your help to develop and finally release them into production until the end of the year.<p>Our software is currently based on Ruby on Rails 5.1.x and we usually use the following stack:<p><pre><code>  - Slim or Haml as the HTML template engine for simple views  \n  - Vuejs 2.x for complex views (keyword: webpacker)\n  - SCSS\n  - Simple SCSS framework like Bourbon with Bitters (*no* Bootstrap or so)\n  - Database: PostgreSQL\n  - Rspec for unit tests\n  - Capybara with Selenium for browser and feature tests\n</code></pre>\nYou will join a small developer team which currently consists of one full time developer and two part time (student) developers, so you can be sure you will have a big impact in the team. With it comes some responsibility, though, because it will be your job to bring the development of your project forward at every stack level, be it the backend, database, frontend or CSS. You will constantly learn new things during your work, because nobody can be an expert in all those fields - but you can improve always.<p>We try to release usable prototypes with minimum functionality fast, so our products are in use and we get feedback fast, and then gradually develop them further.<p>Project code is completely hosted on our self run Gitlab instance, including automatic CI run after every push, linting with Rubocop (and some other linters depending on the stack used), automatic deploys to staging and production environments, and review of every merge request by at least one other developer.<p>If you are interested, please e-mail your resume to Markus Doits, apply@stellenticket.de, with the keyword &quot;HN RoR 2017-07&quot;.

It is THE most pervasive, important, and complicated communications network in the world -- somewhere out there things are about to go south. One of the core backbone routers of a major Tier-1 Internet provider is having a bad day. It started with a transient, yet persistent, problem which was only detectable by a slight increase in dropped packets that went mostly unnoticed. An hour later the router suffered a catastrophic failure dumping 500Gbps of traffic onto an already congested alternate path causing ripples across the Internet, disrupting websites and other Internet based services on the U.S Eastern seaboard. Social media is ablaze as frustrated people rant about their favorite website, video, or gaming service being down, or so slow that it\u2019s unusable. While the Internet burns, our customers are humming away oblivious to the disaster.

From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we&#x27;re building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.<p>Interview process:<p>Phone screen -&gt; technical interview -&gt; code project -&gt; product interview -&gt; offer letter!<p>Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you&#x27;re emailing us please include your resume and&#x2F;or LinkedIn profile URL!",

We are looking for someone to join our team as an HPC System Administrator.<p>The SRCC provides lots of services to the Stanford community (which includes non-Stanford researchers collaborating on Stanford research):  We maintain several large compute environments (like Sherlock\u2014yes, the Sherlock mentioned recently on Silicon Valley) for various uses.  We offer consultation services, helping users get the most from our environments.  We offer workshops and training, on topics relevant to the HPC community.  We also offer architecture, sysadmin, and development services to labs.  We also offer hosting in the SRCF, our purpose-built research data center.<p>As HPC System Administrator, you&#x27;re going to be responsible for one of our larger compute environments.  You&#x27;ll also be one of the points of contact for several labs on campus (I&#x27;m the other point of contact).  All of the systems that you&#x27;ll be interacting with will be running Linux, typically either CentOS 6&#x2F;7 or Ubuntu LTS.<p>Even though I summarized the duties in one paragraph, you should expect to have various weird requests come up.  For example, in the 2 years I&#x27;ve been here, I&#x27;ve\u2026<p>\u2022 Automated the DNA post-sequencing workflow for a lab.<p>\u2022 Helped secure a number of systems which hold HIPAA data.<p>\u2022 Acted as the SRCC representative at a number of office hours, where community members come for in-person support.<p>\u2022 Created the foundational Puppet code for the next iteration of our FarmShare cluster.<p>\u2022 Created a one-sheet flyer (with Inkscape and Scribus) that is now used by our manager, and by our faculty liasons.<p>\u2022 Was primarily responsible for our table at a recent open-house.<p>The first three items are things you should expect to do, and the remaining items are the kinds of things that you can step up and do when the need arises.<p>We use tons of different technologies.  We use Puppet in some places, and Rocks in others.  We use technologies (like Infiniband, Lustre, and GPFS) and software (like SLURM and MPI) that you may not have used before, and we also use stuff (like Linux, Git, Apache, Kerberos, and LDAP) that you likely have used before.<p>This position is on-site, on Stanford&#x27;s campus.  We want people to commute as much as possible, so we&#x27;ll pay for your Caltrain; if you live in Santa Clara county, we&#x27;ll also pay for VTA.  Our primary data center is on the SLAC campus, but we have our own van (it&#x27;s pretty cool), so getting around is no problem.<p>You can read the job posting at [1].

We have a handful of enterprise customers, who spend billion-dollar-scale per year on patents, in our private pro beta free trial, and they are getting rapidly more excited and asking us how quickly we can take more of their work and how soon we can expand coverage for their work in Europe and Asia.<p>We are targeting for x-r.ai to become the indispensable platform that all patent attorneys need to work competitively.  Under our anti-troll license, any non-practicing entity and their outside law firms, and anyone who sues a startup for patent infringement and their outside law firms, will be banned from using x-r.ai, while startups sued for patent infringement and their outside law firms can use x-r.ai pro for free.

Everyone has had a manager that makes them want to call in sick. Everyone has had a manager who regularly forces their team to chase their own tail doing meaningless work.<p>Why? Because most managers manage their teams blindly. They don&#x27;t hire, coach and promote based on data. Instead, they make decisions based on their gut. These decisions are made because managers don\u2019t have the data to make smarter, more informed decisions when it comes to managing.<p>Not anymore. At People.ai we\u2019re helping managers make decisions about their team based on data, not intuition. We\u2019re starting with sales teams because they\u2019re a particularly notorious black box.

You must have a proven record of consistently meeting and exceeding quota in a fast-paced, competitive sales environment.<p>Our Customer Success team is looking for a Customer Support Manager.  This person will be responsible for managing customer support requests via email, chat and phone and helping to build a world-class customer support organization. Prior experience with Zendesk, Intercom, Jira, Salesforce Service Cloud, etc. is a plus!<p>This isn\u2019t just another job.
