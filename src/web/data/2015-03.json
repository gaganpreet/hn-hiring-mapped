An extreme example: we scheduled thousands of meetings entirely manually for our first Clara customers before building any software at all.</p><p>Accepting human dependency is the fastest way to building useful machine intelligence. The failure of intelligence products to date has fundamentally been a failure to build trust.  It is the consequence of unreliability and lack of focus (think: Siri). Conversely, Clara has delivered a highly reliable, focused, and useful natural language interface from day one.</p><p>We\u2019re looking for frontend, backend, and machine learning engineers to join our early team.

Each state had its most common profession listed over the period of 1978-2014. For 2014, you'll see that truck driving is by far and away and the most common profession. No real surprise there. However, if you look closely, you'll see that in Utah, Virginia, Washington and Colorado that software developer has become that states most common profession. How amazing! I am convinced that within the next 2-8 years, we'll start to see a gargantuan shift where tech skills are in such demand (even more so than now) that Software Developers become the most commonplace profession across the US and world.

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there's no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We're changing that. It's a fascinating data problem as we're mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody's explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What's the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?</p><p>We're trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we're building a team-facing solution, and we're expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here's our team's take on the space: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567</a> Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don't mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we're in. We've had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it. You'd be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we'd work well together. For our data roles, we prefer Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.</p><p>Email falon@node.io</p></font>",

We already have what we believe is the largest database of events happening in the U.S. and 6 other countries.</p><p>With that data in hand, we want to make it fun and effortlessly easy to find the events that you're interested in near you.  Our beta site launched last May and is a good start.  But there's plenty more to do: we want to add personalized event recommendations, apps for iOS and Android, email alerts when your favorite band/comedian/author is coming to town, and much more.  This is a big and broad idea and will keep us busy for quite some time to come.  :)</p><p>We're a 6-person startup with 2 technical cofounders, 3 engineers (2 are also data scientists) and a graphic designer.  We have team members who worked at Google and MIT Lincoln Labs and who went to MIT, Princeton and BU.  All of us work on site in Cambridge, MA.  We're using cool technologies such as Scala, Angular and scikit-learn.</p><p>We'd like to add a couple more engineers to our team.  Check out our job description at <a href=\"https://roundtown.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://roundtown.com/jobs</a> and let us know at jobs@roundtown.com if interested.  Thanks!</p></font>",

HubSpot loves investing in Engineering as a way to build a world-class product.</p><p>On the front-end, we use technologies like CoffeeScript and React to create a wonderful experience for our users interacting with the system.</p><p>On the back-end, we use technologies like HBase, Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and Dropwizard.  If you haven't looked at Dropwizard, it's actually a really nice way to develop web services in Java: you can annotate paths like you would do in Python and Flask and just return a Java object that will be serialised into JSON for you by Jackson.</p><p>Engineering is organised into small teams (usually around 3 people) where you can have a big impact on the product.  We deploy hundreds of times per day and use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, and an internally developed open-source system built on top of Mesos called Singularity to deploy app instance containers.  Your changes won't be languishing in git waiting for a major release.  Because deploys are so painless, we're able to deploy small changes.</p><p>If Google's catch-phrase is \"Don't be evil\" ours is \"use good judgement\".  Check out our Culture Code for more information: <a href=\"http://www.culturecode.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.culturecode.com</a>.  Also take a look at our 2014 Year in Review if you're interested: <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/y0zbyd0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hubs.ly/y0zbyd0</a>.</p><p>Work schedules are flexible, though most engineers get in around 10am.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic. Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people. That's the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.</p></font>",

In order to check-in, all the worker must do is to send this code as an SMS within this 30 second timeframe. Timesheets are generated automatically and are available instantaneously in the textin.io web dashboard.</p><p>Your job is to prospect, generate leads, engage potential customers, handle inbound leads and, most importantly, perform direct sales of:\n1) Textin platform subscription (monthly reoccurring payment)\n2) Clocker devices (one-time cost, shipped worldwide by DHL)</p><p>As sales, your commission will be the first 4 months of reoccurring payments from the deal you close sent to you monthly for 4 months after each payment from the client.</p><p>The end-price of a single Clocker device to the client is ~10$ (depending on amount). Shipping is included. We sell them at cost or loss.</p><p>The platform subscription starts at $5 per worker (discounts available). So netting a company that tracks 100 workers nets you $2000 during 4 month period (5<i>100</i>4=2000).</p><p>Our clients are in Construction, Cleaning, Delivery, Hospitality, Real estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel &amp;Tourism.</p><p>The main pain-point Textin addresses is temporary or outsourced workers, as it requires no additional equipment or training. The worker must use their own phone, and simply text (send as SMS) a 6-digit number they see with their own eyes to a number. All the manager must do, on the other hand, is simply enter the worker's phone number and name to Textin dashboard.</p><p>Apply at info@textin.io</p></font>",

This group plans on-orbit activities, trains astronauts to perform spacewalks (at the NBL and other facilities), and assists astronauts with execution of missions from MCC. This is one of the coolest jobs on the planet. In addition to working on projects that you get to see played out in space, you get to do things like SCUBA and work in the spacesuit in the NBL.</p><p>While not officially part of the job posting, having a background in software would be awesome; there are huge portions of our jobs begging to be automated.

Because of that we're able to do a lot of really cool things including offer health insurance at a massive discount, as well as bring many other benefits traditionally reserved for large companies to startups and SMBs. We're growing very quickly (35-40% month over month) and just raised a $6mm series A from Thrive, Index, a few others[1]. Our founders are former Amazon, Etsy and Groupon executives who have had successful startups in the past.\nWe handle payments and lots of very sensitive information (bank numbers, social security numbers etc.) so we need people who are comfortable working in that environment. Basically we're looking for senior level engineers to help build the foundation for a really awesome engineering org. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions (will@justworks.com). We're also hiring in sales.\n<a href=\"http://www.justworks.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.justworks.com/careers/</a></p><p>Full time in NYC only, no contractors, no remotes, sorry.</p><p>[1] <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-raises-6-million-to-help-businesses-handle-employee-benefits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/10/09/justworks-rai...</a></p></font>",

In startup talk, you could say, \"we are a venture-backed company disrupting a multi-billion dollar industry.\" In real talk, we're bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manilla envelopes holding vital documents. We are bringing security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based office.</p><p>About you: You've got 2-5 years experience building web apps. You're interested in owning a product, everything from calling clients to wireframes to writing code and analyzing metrics.</p><p>More about us: We're growing fast (double-digit month-over-month). We do SaaS for non-technical users. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy, and that feels great. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we're looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.</p><p>Details: This is an onsite position. But we're open to remote-to-hire as well. For the right candidate, we would do something like an initial week on-site in SF. After that, we have 1-2 months of remote work. If at that point all signs point to yes, then we'd ask you to move to sunny San Francisco.</p><p>We offer health insurance and generous vacation. Compensation will be salary plus meaningful equity. As an early engineer you'll be shaping this company.</p><p>Specific Qualifications:</p><p>* 3-5 years of web development (the more, the better)</p><p>* 1-2 years of Ruby on Rails (the more, the better)</p><p>* Experience with AWS, Github, Pivotal Tracker is great -  Project Management ability a huge plus.</p><p>* Be reliable and a hard worker.

It's crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven't caught up to the 21st century.\nOur team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance/Twitter/Google, (we built large parts of Twitter's growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.\nIf you're interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API \n  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces \n  - Write software to build machine learned user models \n  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data \n  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform\n</code></pre>\nSome aspects of our culture that make us different:<p></p><pre><code>  - We are all very focused on self improvement \n  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want)\n  - We are chill and empathetic people \n  - The company is completely transparent\n</code></pre>\nTechnologies you'll work with:<p></p><pre><code>  - Scala\n  - ElasticSearch\n  - Postgres\n  - Redis\n  - AngularJS\n  - Play Framework\n  - RabbitMQ</code></pre>\nYou'll get to work with us at our office at 5th and Market in San Francisco.

New York City. Sunnyvale.</p><p>Application Security Consultant</p><p>Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available</p><p>..............*________________________________________________________</p><p></p><pre><code>   &lt;Mission Impossible theme plays&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis thread will, no doubt, be dominated by posts with laundry lists of requirements.  Many employers will introduce themselves by describing what they want from you.  At Matasano, we're a little different.  We like to start by telling you about us.  This month, I want to try to do that by drawing analogy to Mission Impossible.<p>What made the original show so great is exactly what was lost in the 'Tom Cruise takes on the world' reboot. The original 1960's and 70's Mission Impossible was defined primarily by a team working together against all odds to achieve their objective.  It acknowledged that what they were doing was improbable, and more so for a solo James Bond or Tom Cruise character. As a team though, each character an expert in their particular focus area, the incredible became credible -- the impossible, possible.</p><p>Working at Matasano is a bit like working for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).  No, we're not taking out thinly veiled cold war era Soviet stand in villains, preventing the rise of the third reich, or being tasked with gathering evidence against criminals \"outside the reach of conventional law enforcement.\"  But in many cases, we're given tight timelines and tasked with difficult objectives.  To the uninitiated, what we do is often seen as impossible, but _together_ we do it every day.</p><p>Imagine you (and your team) have a month to circumvent a real world cryptographic system designed and sold for Fortune 500 companies to protect their most sensitive intellectual property.  Maybe you're given a week to investigate and undercover flaws in a brand new Ruby on Rails application.  You might find yourself facing a never-before-seen client/server application, implementing a proprietary binary protocol, and having to figure it out and attack it.  You could end up drawing on binary reverse engineer skills, or reviewing Java code.  But whatever the 'mission', you won't be alone.  You'll be part of a team of experts, each bringing their own skill set to the team.</p><p>We don't have very much call for demolitions experts, special effects makeup artists, or champion weightlifters.  Like the IMF, we're looking for people with diverse backgrounds who each bring something unique to the team. There's little in computing that isn't useful for an Application Security Consultant.  We need Reverse Engineers. Developers of all backgrounds, Cryptographers, Electrical Engineers, you name it.  We're as likely to hire a Mathematics PHD as a college drop out.  Many of our best employees have little formal information technology background.  In short, we come from a variety of backgrounds, but share one common trait -- We're curious about nearly everything, and have a wide base of knowledge, but have achieved mastery over one (or more) disciplines.  These are the sorts of people the IMF built their team from, and they're the sort of people who we're looking for at Matasano.</p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to visit www.matasano.com/careers to learn more and contact us.  In the enclosed dossier, you'll find links to www.cryptopals.com and www.microcorruption.com which may be of interest.  Further intelligence is available at the chargen.matasano.com blog, and you can always contact careers@matasano.com with any remaining questions.  As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.</p><p>This isn't Mission Difficult, it's Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.</p><p>This tape will self destruct in five seconds.  Good luck.</p><p>________________________________________________________________--(BOOM)</p></font>",

We've dominated our niche since 2005. When you see it, you'll think: ah, that's both cool and useful.</p><p>The site is built on PHP 5.6 / Kohana, MySQL, and jQuery. 99% of the code was written in-house and is clean, modular, built on a sane schema, and is easy to develop with minimal external dependencies. It's also really fast; we're near the top of the New Relic leaderboard for our category and in the 90th percentile of site speed according to Google. We take pride in what we built, and we're looking for someone who is proud of their work to continue what we've started.</p><p>We're seeking a developer who can spend approximately 20 hours a week working on discrete, meaningful projects on the site. We have more of these projects than we can count, so consider this a long term project where you'll have the chance to work on a wide variety of interesting stuff, based on your skills and interest.</p><p>Here are a few real example projects that are coming up:\n* Integrate some additional song providers alongside iTunes and Amazon using our song search job queue.\n* Create the concept of timestamping for our data, modifying a variety of model and view classes, as well as adding Bootstrap modal components and forms in our templates.\n* Add features to our REST API.\n* Create front-end features for admins and superusers using HTML and jQuery.\n* Make a real-time activity section on our front page based on activity data we keep in redis.\n* Add a redis caching layer on top of our models to reduce MySQL query volume.\n* Add artist @handles to our tweets.\n* Plus many more...</p><p>We manage projects using a private Github repository and task list. Our specifications are short and to the point. Your code will go live on the site as soon as it's ready -- no long release cycles.</p><p>Critically, you don't need design or sysadmin skill to work on this project. At all. We expect you to generate good HTML structure but if you never touch our CSS or fiddle with images, that's fine by us. Same goes for setting up servers, patching PHP, etc. We've got that all covered.</p><p>The ideal candidate will be able to show us what they've done using the technologies listed above. Experience with Laraval (likely future framework) and/or Kohana ideal, but not required. Honesty and strong communication skills are critical. Comfort with Github, pull requests, and the git toolchain generally is important -- we'll ask for your Github username when we consider your application. We'll give you all the support you need, but expect you to dive in and own large parts of our application.</p><p>Interested? Email amanda@tunefind.com</p></font>",

We measure how busy places are, what people do, how fast cars go, and much more. We offer that data to developers, citizens, cities, and retailers, radically changing the way they interact with the physical world.</p><p>We built our platform around privacy.

BECAUSE THAT'S THE SORT OF PEOPLE WE ARE!!!<p>Are you like us? Do you enjoy working on challenging problems that directly impact and empower customers at a massive scale? Are you interested in innovating and engineering services and website platforms that power our business operations? Are you sick to death of empowering some no-good butterfly? DO YOU WANT TO STICK YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SCREAM \"I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT FRONT END AND BACK END DEVELOPMENT AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY MORE\"?!?!? If so, maybe this is your kinda place, yeah? Yeah. YEAH. YEAH.</p><p>In this job, you\u2019ll learn: that Mr. Tibetan Butterfly isn't so bad, really. He's just a butterfly trying to get by in the world. In fact, you two would really get along. Maybe you should go get a few drinks together some weeknight. Watch the game. You know, talk it out.</p><p>Intangible benefits: A chance to build great software for customers. Have you ever touched software? Huh? If you said yes, you're WRONG. You touched the device on which the software is stored. Just like a story. Or a poem. Or song. Or your memories of childhood.</p><p>Potential hazards: If you start talking about poems and songs and your memories of childhood too much, someone's gonna punch you in the arm. So just be warned.</p><p>If Woot were a superhero team, you\u2019d be: yeah, funny thing. There aren't yet a lot of superheroes who got their powers after being bitten by a mobile app. But the moment a hero like that shows up? That'll be you. That'll be you all the way.</p><p>Worst part of the job: when the butterfly shows up drunk and starts ranting about how people don't take him seriously as a weather controlling device. He'll try to convince you that HAARP is just twenty billion butterflies strapped to a board. Just smile and nod. Smile and nod.</p><p>Make sure you bring: a custom printed purple shirt that reads \"I got tricked into wearing this by the guy who writes the job descriptions.\" Wear it. Show it off to everyone. They'll totally be checking for it too. snicker</p><p>Basic Qualifications:</p><p>\u2022Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science or related field</p><p>\u20223+ years professional experience in software development</p><p>\u2022Strong understanding of computer science fundamentals, including object-oriented design, data structures, algorithm design, problem solving, and complexity analysis</p><p>\u2022Proficiency in, at least, one object oriented language such as C#, C++ or Java</p><p>\u2022Solid knowledge of website fundamentals such as Javascript, HTML, XML, and CSS</p><p>Preferred Qualifications:\n\u2022Experience crafting automated unit, integration, functional, and regression tests</p><p>\u2022Experience developing RESTful APIs with ASP.NET MVC</p><p>\u2022Experience refactoring code and evolving architectures</p><p>\u2022Experience with distributed computing and enterprise-wide systems</p><p>\u2022Knowledge of professional software engineering practices for the full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations</p><p>\u2022Experience in communicating with users, other technical teams, and management to collect requirements, describe software product features, and technical designs</p><p>Tl;dr: Woot is looking for full-stak developers in Seattle.\nPM me if you are interested.</p></font>",
