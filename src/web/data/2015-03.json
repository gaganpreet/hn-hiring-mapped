We\u2019re looking for full-stack generalists and iOS and Android pros.</p><p>WHAT WE DO: We\u2019re building a platform and loyalty network that connects mobile apps together.  We\u2019ve announced partnerships with Uber, Resy, and Tablelist, and we\u2019re just getting started.  (The nature of what we do puts us in touch with a <i>lot</i> of growing mobile startups.)</p><p>WHO WE\u2019RE AFTER: We\u2019re a merry band of hackers and entrepreneurs, and we\u2019re looking for someone similarly minded.  Our backend is a mix of NodeJS and Golang, and we have a rich iOS SDK (and need help building Android).</p><p>Ideally you\u2019ll have 5+ years of experience working on hard technical problems in a related environment.  But more important is an ability to work through hard problems, a drive to innovate, and an insistence on clean and well-tested code.  Our lead engineers are veterans of Google and Venmo.</p><p>WHAT YOU\u2019LL DO: As engineer #6, you\u2019ll either specialize in our mobile SDK or our backend.  Both are being built to integrate into hundreds of top-tier apps, with millions of users per day, so performance and correctness are absolutely critical.  We\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do, so as an early engineer you\u2019ll have a lot of influence over design decisions and directions.</p><p>CONTACT: Interested?

HubSpot loves investing in Engineering as a way to build a world-class product.</p><p>On the front-end, we use technologies like CoffeeScript and React to create a wonderful experience for our users interacting with the system.</p><p>On the back-end, we use technologies like HBase, Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, ZooKeeper, and Dropwizard.  If you haven't looked at Dropwizard, it's actually a really nice way to develop web services in Java: you can annotate paths like you would do in Python and Flask and just return a Java object that will be serialised into JSON for you by Jackson.</p><p>Engineering is organised into small teams (usually around 3 people) where you can have a big impact on the product.  We deploy hundreds of times per day and use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, and an internally developed open-source system built on top of Mesos called Singularity to deploy app instance containers.  Your changes won't be languishing in git waiting for a major release.  Because deploys are so painless, we're able to deploy small changes.</p><p>If Google's catch-phrase is \"Don't be evil\" ours is \"use good judgement\".

Also take a look at our 2014 Year in Review if you're interested: <a href=\"http://hubs.ly/y0zbyd0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hubs.ly/y0zbyd0</a>.</p><p>Work schedules are flexible, though most engineers get in around 10am.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic. Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people. That's the best thing about HubSpot: the people are great people that you can rely on, learn from, and have a great time getting things done with.</p></font>",

This group plans on-orbit activities, trains astronauts to perform spacewalks (at the NBL and other facilities), and assists astronauts with execution of missions from MCC.

In addition to working on projects that you get to see played out in space, you get to do things like SCUBA and work in the spacesuit in the NBL.</p><p>While not officially part of the job posting, having a background in software would be awesome; there are huge portions of our jobs begging to be automated.

New York City. Sunnyvale.</p><p>Application Security Consultant</p><p>Full-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available</p><p>..............*________________________________________________________</p><p></p><pre><code>   &lt;Mission Impossible theme plays&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis thread will, no doubt, be dominated by posts with laundry lists of requirements.  Many employers will introduce themselves by describing what they want from you.  At Matasano, we're a little different.  We like to start by telling you about us.  This month, I want to try to do that by drawing analogy to Mission Impossible.<p>What made the original show so great is exactly what was lost in the 'Tom Cruise takes on the world' reboot. The original 1960's and 70's Mission Impossible was defined primarily by a team working together against all odds to achieve their objective.  It acknowledged that what they were doing was improbable, and more so for a solo James Bond or Tom Cruise character. As a team though, each character an expert in their particular focus area, the incredible became credible -- the impossible, possible.</p><p>Working at Matasano is a bit like working for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF).  No, we're not taking out thinly veiled cold war era Soviet stand in villains, preventing the rise of the third reich, or being tasked with gathering evidence against criminals \"outside the reach of conventional law enforcement.\"  But in many cases, we're given tight timelines and tasked with difficult objectives.  To the uninitiated, what we do is often seen as impossible, but _together_ we do it every day.</p><p>Imagine you (and your team) have a month to circumvent a real world cryptographic system designed and sold for Fortune 500 companies to protect their most sensitive intellectual property.  Maybe you're given a week to investigate and undercover flaws in a brand new Ruby on Rails application.  You might find yourself facing a never-before-seen client/server application, implementing a proprietary binary protocol, and having to figure it out and attack it.  You could end up drawing on binary reverse engineer skills, or reviewing Java code.  But whatever the 'mission', you won't be alone.  You'll be part of a team of experts, each bringing their own skill set to the team.</p><p>We don't have very much call for demolitions experts, special effects makeup artists, or champion weightlifters.  Like the IMF, we're looking for people with diverse backgrounds who each bring something unique to the team. There's little in computing that isn't useful for an Application Security Consultant.  We need Reverse Engineers. Developers of all backgrounds, Cryptographers, Electrical Engineers, you name it.  We're as likely to hire a Mathematics PHD as a college drop out.  Many of our best employees have little formal information technology background.  In short, we come from a variety of backgrounds, but share one common trait -- We're curious about nearly everything, and have a wide base of knowledge, but have achieved mastery over one (or more) disciplines.  These are the sorts of people the IMF built their team from, and they're the sort of people who we're looking for at Matasano.</p><p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to visit www.matasano.com/careers to learn more and contact us.  In the enclosed dossier, you'll find links to www.cryptopals.com and www.microcorruption.com which may be of interest.  Further intelligence is available at the chargen.matasano.com blog, and you can always contact careers@matasano.com with any remaining questions.  As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.</p><p>This isn't Mission Difficult, it's Mission Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.</p><p>This tape will self destruct in five seconds.  Good luck.</p><p>________________________________________________________________--(BOOM)</p></font>",

We've dominated our niche since 2005. When you see it, you'll think: ah, that's both cool and useful.</p><p>The site is built on PHP 5.6 / Kohana, MySQL, and jQuery. 99% of the code was written in-house and is clean, modular, built on a sane schema, and is easy to develop with minimal external dependencies. It's also really fast; we're near the top of the New Relic leaderboard for our category and in the 90th percentile of site speed according to Google. We take pride in what we built, and we're looking for someone who is proud of their work to continue what we've started.</p><p>We're seeking a developer who can spend approximately 20 hours a week working on discrete, meaningful projects on the site. We have more of these projects than we can count, so consider this a long term project where you'll have the chance to work on a wide variety of interesting stuff, based on your skills and interest.</p><p>Here are a few real example projects that are coming up:\n* Integrate some additional song providers alongside iTunes and Amazon using our song search job queue.\n* Create the concept of timestamping for our data, modifying a variety of model and view classes, as well as adding Bootstrap modal components and forms in our templates.\n* Add features to our REST API.\n* Create front-end features for admins and superusers using HTML and jQuery.\n* Make a real-time activity section on our front page based on activity data we keep in redis.\n* Add a redis caching layer on top of our models to reduce MySQL query volume.\n* Add artist @handles to our tweets.\n* Plus many more...</p><p>We manage projects using a private Github repository and task list. Our specifications are short and to the point. Your code will go live on the site as soon as it's ready -- no long release cycles.</p><p>Critically, you don't need design or sysadmin skill to work on this project. At all. We expect you to generate good HTML structure but if you never touch our CSS or fiddle with images, that's fine by us. Same goes for setting up servers, patching PHP, etc. We've got that all covered.</p><p>The ideal candidate will be able to show us what they've done using the technologies listed above. Experience with Laraval (likely future framework) and/or Kohana ideal, but not required. Honesty and strong communication skills are critical. Comfort with Github, pull requests, and the git toolchain generally is important -- we'll ask for your Github username when we consider your application. We'll give you all the support you need, but expect you to dive in and own large parts of our application.</p><p>Interested? Email amanda@tunefind.com</p></font>",

And that's why we go out and buy a fan, so we don't have to wait on some stupid butterfly to wake up and flap. We alter the wind IMMEDIATELY. BECAUSE THAT'S THE SORT OF PEOPLE WE ARE!!!<p>Are you like us? Do you enjoy working on challenging problems that directly impact and empower customers at a massive scale? Are you interested in innovating and engineering services and website platforms that power our business operations? Are you sick to death of empowering some no-good butterfly?

You know, talk it out.</p><p>Intangible benefits: A chance to build great software for customers. Have you ever touched software? Huh? If you said yes, you're WRONG.

So just be warned.</p><p>If Woot were a superhero team, you\u2019d be: yeah, funny thing. There aren't yet a lot of superheroes who got their powers after being bitten by a mobile app. But the moment a hero like that shows up? That'll be you. That'll be you all the way.</p><p>Worst part of the job: when the butterfly shows up drunk and starts ranting about how people don't take him seriously as a weather controlling device. He'll try to convince you that HAARP is just twenty billion butterflies strapped to a board. Just smile and nod. Smile and nod.</p><p>Make sure you bring: a custom printed purple shirt that reads \"I got tricked into wearing this by the guy who writes the job descriptions.\" Wear it. Show it off to everyone. They'll totally be checking for it too. snicker</p><p>Basic Qualifications:</p><p>\u2022Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science or related field</p><p>\u20223+ years professional experience in software development</p><p>\u2022Strong understanding of computer science fundamentals, including object-oriented design, data structures, algorithm design, problem solving, and complexity analysis</p><p>\u2022Proficiency in, at least, one object oriented language such as C#, C++ or Java</p><p>\u2022Solid knowledge of website fundamentals such as Javascript, HTML, XML, and CSS</p><p>Preferred Qualifications:\n\u2022Experience crafting automated unit, integration, functional, and regression tests</p><p>\u2022Experience developing RESTful APIs with ASP.NET MVC</p><p>\u2022Experience refactoring code and evolving architectures</p><p>\u2022Experience with distributed computing and enterprise-wide systems</p><p>\u2022Knowledge of professional software engineering practices for the full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations</p><p>\u2022Experience in communicating with users, other technical teams, and management to collect requirements, describe software product features, and technical designs</p><p>Tl;dr: Woot is looking for full-stak developers in Seattle.\nPM me if you are interested.</p></font>",
