The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of development (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms); so it&#x27;s a great position if you want to develop broader technical skills while really taking advantage of your growing knowledge of our vertical.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic&#x27;s central, highly automated &#x27;biocenter&#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how &quot;identical&quot; reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility. You&#x27;ll have an opportunity to do original research with internal capacity, too.<p>We&#x27;re a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>\u25e6 skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>\u25e6 desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>\u25e6 understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>\u25e6 clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.

We&#x27;re using a great YC company&#x27;s billing product.<p>2) Great front-end engineers -- building new UI&#x2F;UX to expose controls and data to customers is an increasing portion of what we do. Our current front-end stack is Backbone + Marionette with Browserify and Sass. Our new projects are using React + Redux + Babel + css-modules, and generally adopting Higher Order Components. We&#x27;re also starting the process of re-imagining our main WWW Front-end stack with a migration to Redux.<p>3) Systems Engineer -- looking for people to help serve even more traffic, build infrastructure for security and robustness, and contribute back to open source projects.  We make extensive use of nginx, lua&#x2F;luajit, and ssl-at-scale.<p>4) &quot;Prototyping engineers&quot; -- people who want to prototype things in go (backend) through js frontend.  We&#x27;re adding a lot of new products in 2016, and people who love building the first prototype and pilot versions of these products make everything faster.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, please apply through the <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;join-our-team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;join-our-team</a> link.",

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.
