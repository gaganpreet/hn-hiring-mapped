It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 48,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 85 (37 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers and engineering managers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.

We measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity using mobile apps. There are two strands to this. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Right now we&#x27;re trying to make the world&#x27;s workplaces happier, and working mostly B2B.<p>WHO WE ARE. Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design.

Our back-end is node.js and Postgres, with heavy use of JSONB.<p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE. You&#x27;re smart, curious, motivated. Perhaps you have some really solid JavaScript expertise backed up with a little bit of Android \u2014 or maybe it&#x27;s the other way around.

Help us build the web tools to wrangle billions of transactions every day.<p>#About Connexity<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unconstrained vacation (don&#x27;t worry about having to build up enough vacation days for the family reunion); the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising (banner ads, RTB) inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools. We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship in Santa Monica.<p>#Position: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of development (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms); so it&#x27;s a great position if you want to develop broader technical skills while really taking advantage of your growing knowledge of our vertical.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>\u25e6 skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>\u25e6 desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>\u25e6 understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>\u25e6 clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight. So, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.
