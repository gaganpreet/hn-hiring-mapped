The field of NLP parsing has been moving slowly for the last 20 years because of its utter dependence on labelled training data such as the Penn Treebank. In my research I&#x27;ve discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. Even though its still in the early stages of development, the parser works quite well, makes more refined grammatical distinctions than any other widely available parser, and was built without any labelled training data. I&#x27;ve spent the last couple of years working on my own, and now that I&#x27;m confident the approach is valid, I&#x27;m looking to build up a team. I&#x27;m flexible on exact qualifications, but here are general blueprint of what I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- Strong programming and software architecture skills<p>- Good background in math, statistics, machine learning, information theory<p>- Deep interest in language and linguistics<p>The software is built in Java, Postgres, and AWS, but I won&#x27;t ask for any specific technology as long as you have demonstrable programming skill.<p>I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won&#x27;t be for everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a> !",

Our backend is implemented in OCaml (and some C++), as such proficiency in OCaml is very much appreciated, otherwise a strong inclination to intensively learn OCaml in a short term will be required. Understanding of functional programming in general and&#x2F;or experience with other FP languages (F#,Haskell,Scala,Scheme,etc) will help a lot.

Backend system is powered by a custom petabyte-scale distributed key-value storage to accommodate all that data coming in at high speed. The storage system is implemented in OCaml with thin performance-critical low-level part implemented in C++. On top of that Ahrefs is building various analytical services for end-users.<p>We are a small team and strongly believe in better technology leading to better solutions for real-world problems. We worship functional languages and static typing, extensively employ code generation and meta-programming, value code clarity and predictability, and are constantly seeking to automate repetitive tasks and eliminate boilerplate, guided by DRY and following KISS. If there is any new technology that will make our life easier - no doubt, we&#x27;ll give it a try. We rely heavily on opensource code (as the only viable way to build maintainable system) and contribute back [1].

We&#x27;re a young team that&#x27;s moving fast and looking for people that love to rapidly iterate on challenging ideas. We&#x27;re a YC company that&#x27;s VC backed, 7 strong, and looking to grow. Two of our cofounders are UCSB alumns, so we&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>Research Candidates<p>We&#x27;re looking for strong deep learning and machine learning researchers to help lead our research programs. We view deep learning as a science, not an art, and we&#x27;re looking for strong scientists: people that can generate, test, and refine hypotheses rapidly, with minimal bias. Fail fast, fail often. That&#x27;s the mantra of startups, and that&#x27;s the mantra of science. Help us rapidly generate targeted hypotheses and approaches for building a system that can comprehend the massive amount of video footage we feed it.

We have lots of big problems to solve. Engineers looking to lead and take on hard projects are welcome. Take cutting-edge research that requires massive clusters to work and make it run in real time on a single machine. Take disparate research results and merge them together into more powerful models. Build a massively parallel system that can comprehend 100Gbps of raw footage streaming from hundreds of cameras.<p>Experience in some of these areas is a plus: high performance and scientific computing, cluster management, deep learning, image processing, performance optimization, algorithmic research. Experience with some of these tools is a plus: cython, numpy, TensorFlow or some other deep learning framework, opencv, nix. If you&#x27;re smart, passionate, and can learn fast on the job, we&#x27;re happy to train an engineer in any and all of these areas.",

We are the first dedicated marketplace for technical interviewers. Karat&#x27;s network of seasoned engineers conduct the first rounds of technical interviews for elite engineering companies. Our robust platform saves teams thousands of valuable hours while allowing them to focus on the top performing candidates.  Karat&#x27;s unique approach recognizes that people are central to the hiring process and that they can be supercharged by leveraging machine learning and our rich database of the world&#x27;s interviews.<p>We face incredible demand for our service and are delivering significant value to elite engineering companies like Interana, BuildZoom and Minted.

Accelerated.<p><i>Who we\u2019re looking for:</i><p>Haskellers with an interest in distributed systems and machine learning. The more production Haskell experience, the better. Applied maths and type theory backgrounds are highly desirable, as is experience with optimizing large in-memory data structures. Our culture is built on a foundation of good communication skills and solid engineering principles. Sentenai has been built with Haskell and running on FreeBSD since day 1, and two years later Sentenai remains committed to Haskell as we grow our engineering team.<p><i>Why?</i><p>Machine intelligence represents a huge potential breakthrough in many industries, from manufacturing to aircraft maintenance. The problem is that working with sensor data to build predictive applications is a slow, time consuming process fraught with data engineering challenges. At Sentenai, we\u2019re determined to change that.<p>Sentenai is the first cloud data infrastructure purpose-built for data scientists and machine learning engineers who need to rapidly mine diverse sensor data sets for behavioral patterns and build targeted training sets for predictive models.<p>At the core of Sentenai is a novel set of distributed machine learning technologies and a distributed time-series query engine that natively understands sensor fusion and cross-stream pattern mining. Applied to our distributed data storage and indexing system, these technologies help Sentenai abstract away the details or data preparation, storage and querying on time series data to provide users with a clean data interface to their data without exposing them to the complexities of the underlying database technologies we develop.<p><i>Company details:</i><p>Sentenai is based in Cambridge, MA in Central Square. Our founding team has deep experience in the IoT space and our engineering team consists of Haskell engineers with a wide range of experience levels (from two to ten years) and non-computer interests (like travel, euro games, playing music, cooking, and hunting for fine wine). We love open source and conferences&#x2F;meetups, so you\u2019ll probably see some of us attending various conferences or organizing meetups around our interests. Our investors include funds like Flybridge, Founder Collective, Hyperplane and Project 11.<p>Sound interesting? Contact us at jobs@sentenai.com.",

Expert Interviewer at Karat (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karat.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karat.io</a>)<p>Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. No minimums or maximums. When each interview is done, you&#x27;re done -- no deadlines or endless list of TODOs to stress about when your workday is over.<p>I know the above sounds a little different from normal software engineering jobs, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders (I&#x27;ll be sharing some of this with the community soon), but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Experience interviewing would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid, on your timeline) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor. We prioritize applicants who can handle at least a few interviews&#x2F;week on average; the more you interview, the better you get at it.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full-timers at top tech companies earning extra cash at night; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>Pay is listed as $70-100&#x2F;hr. To expand on this, we pay $100 for an interview, which usually takes 60 minutes to conduct and then 5-30 minutes to write up. Exeperienced interviewers will typically complete the writeup in 5-15 min. We also have opportunities to do non-interviewing work for interested interviewers, including writing new questions, mentoring new interviewers, etc., which we pay hourly for.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty new&#x2F;unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S. We&#x27;re also hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers, dev managers, and a product manager right now.

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. \nThat\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.
