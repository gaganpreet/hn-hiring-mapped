Near the start, we see Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) close out a bank account, and take the proceeds to the managers.  He pretty tersely says something like:</p><p>\"Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable. \n\tFire exits need to be monitored. \n\tYour rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained. \n\tOutside of that, everything seems to be fine. \n\tYou'll get our full report in a few days. But first, who's got my check?\"\"</p><p>Cut to a bank secretary, writing Martin a check.</p><p>\"So, people hire you to break into their places...\n              ...to make sure no one can break into their places?\"</p><p>Whenever I'm asked to explain what we do at Matasano, this scene comes to mind.  Our work is the digital equivalent; breaking applications so they can be made stronger and more resilient to attack, inoculating the world's software like a binary flu shot.</p><p>Modern applications are a lot like the bank in the movie.  Authentication protects the front door, much like the bank's cameras and guards.  Encryption often protects sensitive data, similar to how steel lined walls protect a bank vault.  Communication protocols convey information in and out, like armored cars ferrying cash to and fro.  Finding the application's 'communication lines', 'fire exits', and 'rent-a-cops' is our goal.  As Application Security Consultants we seek the overlooked, the neglected, the unexpected flaws in an application's code.  Like Martin, we show how these weaknesses can lead to overall failure of the application, and we do this so it can be improved.</p><p>Later in the movie, Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), a villainous ex-con says:\n\t\"The world isn't run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It's run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It's all just electrons.\"\nIn 1992, that might've been hyperbolic but it's becoming more true every day.</p><p>If being part of ensuring the systems we all rely on continue to function safely and reliably, we should talk.  If working with smart people on the cutting edge of technology excites you, we should talk.  If diving deeply into a wide variety of technologies and facing new challenges daily appeals to you, we should talk.  If tearing apart application code and making it do things that its creators didn't intend is fun for you, we should talk.</p><p>You can get a taste for the sorts of things we do at www.microcorruption.com and www.cryptopals.com.</p><p>Reach out to us at careers@matasano.com or by visiting our web site.</p></font>",

We're \"The Company Formerly Known As Inbox,\"[0] and we're looking for help building the next generation email platform. We're building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend engineers, designers, and systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.</p><p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups' entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. If you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)</p><p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven't significantly changed in years. That means an opportunity to tackle big UX challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps.

Apply here[2].</p><p>== We're particularly looking for folks who ==</p><p>* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.</p><p>* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.</p><p>* Put the work before ego. We've got each others' backs, and we want you to be with us on that.</p><p>== A bit more about us ==</p><p>* We're built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, Docker, and Debian.

The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country\u2019s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. There are also other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.\nThe idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice based on our economic theories, and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level. If you're looking for a high-impact job, this is it!</p><p>================================</p><p>* What we want to do:</p><p>We want to focus on building features around this idea of storytelling with data (see example at the end), as well as re-do our UI and design to be cleaner and up to modern standards, and to add better visualization capabilities. We look at NYtimes / WaPo data driven articles with envy. We salivate when we see Tufte's work.\nWe need you, dear frontend engineer, to make all that a reality!</p><p>We use d3.js for the visualizations. We know that at least the visualization part would be ideally suited for a single page app, and we'd love to implement something along those lines with Angular / Backbone / etc. We want to rethink our designs and how the frontend works in general.</p><p>Especially with the new national projects with Colombia and Mexico, you'll have free rein over the creative process and the technological aspects of your work.</p><p>==================================</p><p>* Our stack:</p><p>We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it's jquery / d3 for now. Everything we do is open source: <a href=\"https://github.com/cid-harvard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/cid-harvard</a> and we use Github for bug/feature tracking.</p><p>==================================</p><p>* Work environment / goals:\nComing from the startup world, the work environment is pretty laid back, but everyone is expected to hold their own and get their work done without being micromanaged. No late nights and weekends, although I've been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.</p><p>We're a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher, plus a new super talented designer), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I've been here only for a few months, but I've been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you'll have.</p><p>I'm looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality. We have great plans and dreams for the future of this site, and we need people to help. We'd love to hear more about you and see work samples if possible!

Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia's exports are petrol products:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all...</a></p><p>And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...</a> and \n<a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2710/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/sho...</a></p><p>The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/sho...</a></p><p>There\u2019s practically no one who\u2019s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It\u2019s interesting how it\u2019s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that\u2019s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front. It\u2019s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:</p><p><a href=\"http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all...</a></p><p>Which probably explains why EU hasn't placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.</p></font>",

What if this new network was comprised of the spare computing resources of the world\u2019s Internet users and has already seen over three years of cutting edge C++ 11/14 source code written for it? What if the company building this new platform was based away from cramped, expensive London on Scotland\u2019s tranquil, beautiful and rugged South West coast, yet with excellent transport links to major cities and just a few miles from an International airport?</p><p>The company implementing the replacement for much of the Internet\u2019s services is called MaidSafe and they plan a public launch of the platform later this year.

As the company approaches product launch, they are looking to strengthen their team with C++ engineers experienced in open source software to help nail bugs and add that final polish.\nYour initial role will be to familiarise yourself with MaidSafe\u2019s implementation libraries and once you are comfortable with the code, you will become a key part of MaidSafe\u2019s core development team. \nPlease have a look at the quality of work for yourself at <a href=\"https://github.com/maidsafe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/maidsafe</a>. \nLeading Boost and ISO C++ committee members have contributed to the code; it is an exemplar of modern practice and is written exclusively in C++ 11!

Some links to examples would be great.</p><p>- Proven CI configuration experience,preferably Jenkins though Travis and others are fine, although it would be even better if there is a place on the internet displaying evidence of your experience in this.</p><p>- Proven experience with unit testing frameworks, preferably Google Test although others would be fine too. It would be very useful to provide some links to test code that you have written.</p><p>- Proven experience with writing code for at least two of Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, Android, iOS or WinRT. MaidSafe code is expected to run on all of these. Again links to examples would be great.</p><p>- Proven experience with writing C++11/14 code, especially using the C++ 11/14 STL. Links to examples please!\n- A presence on Stack Overflow, where you have asked or answered hard questions and been recognised by others for your answers.</p><p>- At least a minimum of experience writing C++ which works on Microsoft C++ compiler. MaidSafe code needs to work on Visual Studio 2013, so you would have to constrain your C++ to that feature set whilst awaiting Visual Studio 14 to be released.</p><p>Lovely to have</p><p>- Proven experience with code correctness checking tools such as valgrind, Purify, clang sanitisers and equivalents. Examples of where you have used them would be great.</p><p>- Proven experience with code peer review tools such as Gerrit or equivalents, with links to examples if possible</p><p>- Proven experience with CMAKE on both Windows and on POSIX, again with examples to links if possible</p><p>- Proven experience in writing and debugging multithreaded code, again any links where you wrote or debugged some multithreaded code would be very useful. In an interview, we would certainly ask for details on this as the MaidSafe code base is multithreaded.</p><p>Ideal to have (don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t)</p><p>Proven experience in the Boost C++ libraries and C++ STL. Examples may include:</p><p>- History of posts to mailing lists.</p><p>- Stack Overflow answers.</p><p>- Books written on C++ theory or practice.</p><p>- Papers submitted to ISO C++ standards committees, preferably WG21.</p><p>- Your own code that has passed an open source community review (or even submitted for a review and was rejected).

Rejected\npapers are welcome.</p><p>Working at MaidSafe</p><p>MaidSafe is a small and highly innovative open source technology company where your role is likely to be more varied than the highly specialised roles typical in a corporate employer. They are developing a decentralised and global computing platform that will fundamentally change how the Internet works for millions of users, delivering privacy, security and freedom for everyone. This role provides the opportunity to work for a cutting edge Open Source company with a big future, as well as the freedom to push your skills to the limit.</p><p>The location</p><p>MaidSafe are headquartered in Troon, on Scotland\u2019s beautiful West Coast. Troon is a small and affluent town and has an excellent choice of independent bars, restaurants and shops, with first class transport links including a rail link and an international airport .</p><p>The area is a popular with families and is within easy reach of a number of excellent state and private schools, serving both primary and secondary students.

Located just 30 minutes from Glasgow, Scotland\u2019s largest and most vibrant city, there is easy access to some of Europe\u2019s best shopping and a lively nightlife.</p><p>Compensation</p><p>Being located in Scotland has advantages beyond the clean air and stunning scenery. Household expenditure is just 60% of that in London and average rental payments are 46% below the UK average. Similarly, mortgage payments are 17% below the UK average, while Scotland is estimated to have the 14th best standard of living anywhere in the world, based on GDP. It is also worth noting that the UK median gross annual income within the Information and Communication sector was just under \u00a336,000 in 2012, the highest of all industries.</p><p>Further to a 3 month trial period, the salary at MaidSafe is \u00a340k per annum. New employees will also become part of the employee benefit trust, an ownership scheme that currently distributes more than 25% of the company\u2019s shares amongst a team of 15.</p><p>How to apply</p><p>Please supply MaidSafe with a list of URLs of evidence showing them why you would be a great hire, explaining the context of those URLs where necessary and the company will get back to you if we would like any additional information.</p></font>",

Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let\u2019s make a crane talk to our servers.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one.

Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.</p><p>We will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems. Even though are moving fast we will also be building our processes and culture and we\u2019re looking for someone who is excited to help us do that.</p><p>Responsibilities</p><p>Building and expanding our distributed service-oriented/API-driven architecture \nCoding the wearable tech and base stations\nScaling our data collection capabilities \nHelping build and expand our analytics and event engine\nMany, many other things</p><p>Technical Skills/Minimum Requirements</p><p>The ideal candidate must meet the following minimum requirements:</p><p>You are fluent in Python, Ruby, or another scripting language. Ideally you are a polyglot.\nWe will be making web interfaces so of course JS/HTML/CSS skills are required.\nYou know or are not afraid to get to know C/other low level languages.\nYou have used relational databases, and at least have looked into some non-relational database. Column oriented database experience a plus!\nYou have used MVC frameworks before (Django/Rails/Laravel/etc), and have used at least one Javascript framework.\nYou enjoy writing clean readable code and don't mind getting rid of old code when it's the right thing to do.\nYou haven't used some_random_technology? Great! We'll likely be using a lot of that.\nThis means you don't mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly.\nVersion control is a must. We use Git.</p><p>Important Non-tech Factors</p><p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough.\nAn experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting.\nGood communications skills and personal accountability are a must.\nWhen things go wrong, tell people and fix them.\nAs the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor.\nExperience working in a startup is a plus.</p><p>Technical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy/be interesting)</p><p>Working with/messing around with Unity or other gaming/3D engines.\nPrior experience with Arduino/other hardware prototyping.\nExperience with hardware/EE.\nFamiliarity with Machine Learning.</p><p>Don't hit all the bullet points? Apply anyways, it would be totally unreasonable to expect someone to have all of the above, we're really more concerned about finding smart devs who think this sounds like a really interesting project.

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use.

On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, CoffeeScript, and React today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>We're a rapidly growing startup (you'd be #19), well funded ($6M: Google Ventures, IA Ventures, Data Collective, AME Cloud, Founders Fund) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

That developer could be you!</p><p>If you've ever wanted to work with a world-class team on a brand new type of product that is being used for good in some of the biggest companies in the world, this could be your chance.</p><p>### What does WeSpire do?</p><p>WeSpire gets people to do things that matter, and measures the impact. We use behavior change models to design interactions that encourage people to act differently. Then we measure the delta in their actions, analyze the real-world impact, and display the information back to the user. We started in the sustainability space, and now work for many different applications, including volunteering, diversity, and happiness at work.</p><p>### What will I work on?</p><p>#### 1: Design Implementation</p><p>You will take designs from our product team, and turn them into working features.</p><p>You will work in one of two modes: prototype mode or production mode.</p><p>Sometimes, you will build code to last the next 4 years.</p><p>Sometimes you will build experiments to last the next 4 weeks.</p><p>You will know the difference between prototype mode and production mode and be comfortable working either way, because we are building solutions that are entirely new, and there isn't a ton of known art, so we end up figuring out many things from scratch! (This should excite you)</p><p>#### 2: Writing Code</p><p>When you are writing code you will understand how people will use it, and you will know how to make things intuitive for them. You will also know when to raise the alarm because a feature doesn't fully make sense and will confuse people.</p><p>Sometimes you will write every part of the feature, from CSS to JS to Ruby to SQL.</p><p>Sometimes you will split those responsibilities with a coworker.</p><p>Either way, you will be phenomenal at Ruby and SQL, good at JS, and at least passable at CSS.</p><p>#### 3: Writing Tests</p><p>You will write tests that will give you confidence about the behavior of your methods, of your objects, and of the system as a whole. From these tests, you will design code that is object-oriented, and interfaces between objects that are clear and reduce coupling. You will care about the readability, reusability, and performance of your code, and usually in that order.</p><p>#### 4: Working with Developers</p><p>You will:</p><p>* Work with developers who are similarly obsessed with good design and strong tests\n* Care about your coworkers and be invested in their success as well as your own\n* Be a leader in code quality while reviewing code, while mentoring other developers and defining best practices\n* Re-architect major portions of our application, as we rapidly outgrow our current architecture\n* Push the team to select the right technologies to meet our performance, maintenance, and code quality standards</p><p>### What technologies will I work with?</p><p>* Rails 4.1+\n* Ruby 2.1+\n* Postgres\n* Redis\n* Resque\n* SASS\n* Coffeescript\n* jQuery\n* HAML\n* Git\n* Github\n* Heroku\n* Slack</p><p>### OK, but will I actually like working at WeSpire?</p><p>We think so. If you like tackling difficult problems and working with smart people, you'll feel right at home here. On top of that, we work hard to make sure the company culture is strong and welcoming, and that the work arrangements are flexible enough to work for you.</p><p>Here are some of the things that we do:</p><p>* Work from home Fridays. Pretty much everyone in the company works from home. It saves emissions, which fits with our sustainability roots, and it's nice to have a day to work from your couch.\n* Flexibility on working from home other days too. You will like working from the office, and interacting with your coworkers, but if you have to work from home some day, it's not a big deal.\n* \"Wine Wednesdays\" to bring the entire company together over some drinks\n* \"Meat-free Mondays\" with a chef-prepared vegetarian lunch for the whole company every Monday!\n* The entire company does an outing together at least twice a year. Previous outings: a scavenger hunt through the streets of Boston and Cambridge, a boat trip to a Boston Harbor Island, and a trip to Hopsters to brew our company beers.\n* Speaking of, we brewed our own company beers, a Belgian Quad and a Double IPA. They're not too shabby, if we do say so ourselves.</p><p>### Compensation</p><p>Cash comp paired with equity \u2014 we are looking for the best and will pay them accordingly. Health coverage and dental benefits, 401k plan. The opportunity for growth in a fast-paced progressive company is yours for the taking.</p><p>### To Apply</p><p>Please send a link to projects you are proud of, a resume or LinkedIn profile and your quick thoughts on what\u2019s extremely interesting to you about using technology to inspire positive actions to kim [at] wespire [dot] com.</p></font>",

Help us change that at Clever (YC S12)<p>There\u2019s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can\u2019t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school\u2019s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students\u2026 which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren\u2019t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that\u2019s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.</p><p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven\u2019t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you\u2019re a five-person startup and you\u2019ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there\u2019s simply no way to get your product in front of students.</p><p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools\u2026 which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they\u2019re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we\u2019re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.</p><p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you\u2019ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)</p><p>Right now we\u2019re a team of 40 people (17 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We\u2019re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we\u2019re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If you\u2019re interested, we\u2019d love to hear from you.</p><p>Other stuff we like:\n-Tech talks.  Every other Tuesday, we do \u201cClever Talks\u201d during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he/she\u2019s interested in.  Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what\u2019s wrong with American high school history education.\n-Bughouse chess.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",

Feel free to get in touch via tcui@janestreet.com if you have any questions.)</p><p>Jane Street is a technology-focused proprietary trading firm. We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We\u2019ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world\u2019s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you\u2019re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there\u2019s no better place.</p><p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there\u2019s a lot of room for growth.</p><p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com.

Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Trulia, and Newsweek.</p><p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. A great example is one of our most recent products, Geopulse Audience, which stands at the intersection of high quality places data and large scale analysis of user geo-data: <a href=\"http://www.factual.com/products/geopulse-audience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.factual.com/products/geopulse-audience</a> . If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (<a href=\"http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure</a>), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.</p><p>If interested, email me (my username here at factual.com).</p><p>Here's a typical job description from Jobvite:</p><p><a href=\"http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?nl=1&amp;k=Job&amp;j=oQR1Vfwn&amp;s=Hackernews\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hire.jobvite.com/CompanyJobs/Careers.aspx?nl=1&amp;k=Job&amp;...</a></p></font>",
