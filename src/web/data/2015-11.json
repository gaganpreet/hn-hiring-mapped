Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can&#x27;t be dependent on hierarchy.

Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com</a>",

Oh, yeah! We do SaaS for non-technical users. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy, and that feels great.

This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration.

We started Underdog.io because we experienced the pains associated with (1) hiring while working at top startups and (2) looking for new opportunities.<p>Our platform is currently live in SF and NYC, where we work with 180+ awesome startups. We\u2019ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network. We&#x27;ve proudly bootstrapped and profitable.<p>As we scale, we\u2019ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don\u2019t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies don\u2019t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires. Job search is organized and talented candidates have more high-quality options.<p>We use Python&#x2F;Flask, Javascript&#x2F;Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, AWS. We&#x27;re also working on a project in Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra. And we&#x27;re big supporters of open source.<p>Link to Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underdogio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underdogio</a><p>Link to recent Medium post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@cmuir&#x2F;lessons-from-sixteen-months-of-bootstrapping-at-underdog-io-6deb98344d31\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@cmuir&#x2F;lessons-from-sixteen-months-of-boo...</a><p>Email chris@underdog.io to apply.<p>Keywords: NYC, Brooklyn, Developer, Dev, Engineer, Python, Flask, Node.js, Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Open Source, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;underdog.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;underdog.io&#x2F;</a>",

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.

I guarantee you we&#x27;ll be eating Halloween candy for months to come!<p>NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team.

Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things).

Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.

We believe that what we&#x27;re working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle&#x27;s past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors&#x27; notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We&#x27;ve raised $15m funding and have a small team of 16 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, React and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> .

More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.\nWe&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>#Position 1: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites.

The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible, Scala, Storm, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to help build our data pipeline and optimization systems.  You&#x27;re comfortable working with distributed systems.  You have a firm grasp of data structures, operating JVM systems at scale and generally building reliable systems.
