There\u2019s a core division (cleverly named \u201cAthena Core\u201d) of about 150 engineers which builds a platform and development libraries that are then used by over 5,000 developers throughout the bank.\nThe Core Analytics team currently has 8 members and is responsible for extending Athena to research teams and for reducing the gap between research and production use. To give a simplified example, our typical customer is a quant who might be attempting to create a new pricing model. Core Analytics would help him access relevant data sets, explore that data with a library of common statistical functions to, verify the new model with a back-testing framework, and then finally publish the model to production.\nPython and C++ are the primary languages, but we\u2019re open to considering exceptional developers with any background. Finance experience is certainly not required. Our two main offices are in NYC and London; we also have satellites in Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Singapore.<p>Email Christine.h.ko@jpmchase.com to apply.",

Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can&#x27;t be dependent on hierarchy.

Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphiq.com</a>",

Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities.

Some of the technologies that we\u2019re using: Dropwizard, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks.

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.

Maybe it&#x27;s time to consider that career or company shift you&#x27;ve had on the backburner for so many months? I guarantee you we&#x27;ll be eating Halloween candy for months to come!<p>NCC Group is constantly hiring security consultants from ALL backgrounds to join our team.

Oh, yeah! We do SaaS for non-technical users. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy, and that feels great.

That means we must do research, gather data and talk to customers to inform each of our choices.<p>Snapdoc&#x27;s culture is one that trusts its team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as seeking collaboration. We&#x27;re becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and we&#x27;re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>==Job Description and Required Skills==<p>* Rails Engineer.

We&#x27;ve raised $15m funding and have a small team of 16 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we&#x27;re a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas&#x2F;Numpy&#x2F;etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, React and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We&#x27;re working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers. No medical or life sciences background is necessary. Python, C++, and CUDA experience is helpful - but the proven ability to learn quickly is more important. We&#x27;re also looking for MD&#x2F;PhDs with physics or comp sci backgrounds to help us brings the worlds of medicine and machine learning together.<p>Have a look at our team to see whether you think you might be a good fit <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enlitic.com&#x2F;team.html</a> .

As the engineering team\u2019s second member, you\u2019ll advance the automated cloud infrastructure, currently mainly in Go and running on EC2 and S3, to process and manage &gt;1TB of new biological images per week, among other critical items.<p>Data science: As the second member of our data science team, you\u2019ll collaborate with our biologists to guide our experimental design, improve the models that drive our analysis, and use our data answer questions that guide our scientific and technical strategy. We currently work mainly with the python scientific stack, including pandas and IPython, and making some use of such libraries as sklearn, while also building our own models for machine learning and statistical inference.<p>See the posts linked below for more details.<p>Logistics<p>We&#x27;re based in Research Park at the edge of the mountains overlooking Salt Lake City, Utah. Gorgeous hiking&#x2F;running&#x2F;biking is literally out our back door, and it&#x27;s half an hour to 5 top ski resorts. We offer competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (working at the office is part of the deal), equity, an awesome team to work with, and the chance to impact the world in a massively positive way.<p>Apply<p>Data science post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-python-data-scientist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-python-data-scientist....</a> Data science applications: datasci@recursionpharma.com<p>Software engineering post: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-software-engineer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;senior-software-engineer.html</a>: Applications to engineering @recursionpharma.com.<p>See who we are: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recursionpharma.com&#x2F;team</a>",

I just joined as Principal Engineer and I&#x27;m loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms &amp; machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women&#x27;s Fashion e-commerce &#x2F; subscription service. In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag &quot;#stitchfix&quot; and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month&#x27;s &quot;Fix&#x27;. Our customer referral to friend statistic is off the charts.<p>On the business side, it&#x27;s a startup but we&#x27;re profitable and we&#x27;re not planning on seeking additional funding. Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success. On the Engineering side, we&#x27;re solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I&#x27;m responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. When people hear this sometimes they ask &quot;so what the engineers just sit around and invent features?&quot;...well its not like that. What Product Managers do is talk to all the business stakeholders, customers, consult the A&#x2F;B testing results, take UX design input into account and then try to put that all together. Of course there is still one key business stakeholder that makes the high level calls, but there is a lot of Product Management type work that happens between that decision that typically falls on a product manager and here it falls on the Principal engineer.<p>There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics) They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer satisfaction. Don&#x27;t let the industry (Womens Fashion) put you off. The smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t at least consider it. The engineers I&#x27;m working with really care about the craft of Software Engineering and this is a great environment for anyone that feels the same.<p>Check out our engineering and algorithms web site: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;technology.stitchfix.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;technology.stitchfix.com&#x2F;</a> and here is our jobs page <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stitchfix.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stitchfix.com&#x2F;careers</a>.<p>To reach the hiring managers and recruiting team directly, email tech-jobs (at) stitchfix (dot) com (its not a black hole - it actually goes to the right people.)

(Yes, I know ad-blocking is all the rage these days. Come be part of the solutions by enabling sensible display ads.) We&#x27;re looking for a savvy individual who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.\nYou&#x27;ll be working alongside a tight, driven team right in the heart of the profit center. Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through real time bidding, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>#About Connexity:<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9&#x2F;80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unconstrained vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live&#x2F;work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.\nWe&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>#Position 1: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>#Position 2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible, Scala, Storm, Hbase &amp; Kafka<p>We need someone to help build our data pipeline and optimization systems.  You&#x27;re comfortable working with distributed systems.  You have a firm grasp of data structures, operating JVM systems at scale and generally building reliable systems. We need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward.  If you&#x27;ve wanted the opportunity to build systems that comb through billions of transactions a day, please reach out to us.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",
