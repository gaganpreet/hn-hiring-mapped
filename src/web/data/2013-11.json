We have roughly 4,000 R&amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.</p><p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.</p><p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.</p><p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)</p><p>We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"</p><p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be sponsoring / attending RobotsConf in December, too.</p></font>",

You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It's pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we'll give you. Everyone on our team agrees that this is the most exciting phase of the company that we've seen, and we're growing so quickly that we're all very eager to meet and work with you!</p><p>--------------------</p><p>What skills are we looking for?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>* This is primarily an engineering role, rather than being design or CSS focused. We'd like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.</p><p>* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...</p><p>* ...but not essential. We do have designers.</p><p>* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.</p><p>* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!</p><p>The best way to show this off is to point to things you've built. We'd love to see personal projects which demonstrate the above.</p><p>Is this you?

In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.</p><p>As a company, we have four main focuses.</p><p>Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&amp;B numbers and such.</p><p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.</p><p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=\"http://squareup.com/market\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://squareup.com/market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href=\"http://squareup.com/cash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://squareup.com/cash</a>), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.</p><p>Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.</p><p>In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.</p><p>If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

Our product and business model are proving to be quite disruptive in a very large market. Companies like Netflix, Priceline.com, Deutsche Bank, Williams Sonoma, Betfair and Expedia are using AppDynamics to ensure the performance and availability of their revenue-critical applications.</p><p>AppDynamics' traditional products for JVM, CLR, PHP and Node.js kick ass at measuring server-side performance across your app. But with the shift to highly interactive websites and mobile apps, an increasing number of performance problems are caused by client-side code or internet latency. End-User Monitoring measures the performance that your real users' experience by instrumenting client-side platform APIs. EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:</p><p>* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?</p><p>* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?</p><p>* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions/billions of users?</p><p>* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?</p><p>Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:</p><p>Browser Agent:</p><p>* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.</p><p>* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.</p><p>* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.</p><p>Mobile Agents:</p><p>* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.</p><p>* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.</p><p>* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.</p><p>Cloud:</p><p>* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It's a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map/reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.</p><p>* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.</p><p>* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).</p><p>* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi \nversion, etc.</p><p>* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.</p><p>UI:</p><p>* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.</p><p>* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.</p><p>I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand.

The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.</p><p>The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company's infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.</p><p>The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.</p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES</p><p>Full-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.</p><p>Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.</p><p>System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.</p><p>QUALIFICATIONS</p><p>The ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:</p><p>* Full-time candidates should have B.A./B.Sc., M.A./M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.</p><p>* Four or more years of experience with a low-level/systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.</p><p>* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.</p><p>* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don't need to be a specialist.)</p><p>* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.</p><p>* Ability to read academic publications in Computer Science</p><p>Most importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that</p><p>* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.</p><p>We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.</p><p>COMPENSATION</p><p>Compensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.\nLocation</p><p>To apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.</p></font>",

We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don't, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We're at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.</p><p>We're giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You're startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?</p><p>What do we have to offer?\n* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that's full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.\n* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).\n* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).\n* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).\n* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.\n* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.\n* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you'll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you'll make here versus what you're making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you're after - then this is not for you. If you're looking for adventure, fun, and to challenge your self with something new - welcome to your new home!!!</p><p>Who are we looking for? It's all listed on the website: <a href=\"http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/</a> but in summary:\nHTML/CSS/Javascript kung fu\nMobile dev skills (android or iOS)\nServer dev skills\nCommunity managers/growth hacking</p><p>Our technology stack is HTML5, CSS3, Java, NodeJS, MongoDB, Play Framework, Scala. But don't worry if you don't know these. As long as you have a very solid command of at least one programming language (Java, C, C++, Python, etc) and are smart as a whip, we can teach you the rest. We expect the same things that any software development shop would: ability to write clean, well-documented code, familiarity with Dev Environments (Xcode, CodeIgniter/Play/Angular/etc.), experience with Agile/Scrum concepts, etc. Culturally we look for self-starters that can thrive with very little guidance and who have a genuine passion of solving complex problems. You should also like beer (or not be afraid to watch others consume large quantities of it), music, the sun, and tacos.) Oh yes, and a sense of humor - you'll want to bring that too.\nYou want to know more? Of course you do. Check out the site: www.agavelab.com or drop us an email.

If you don't know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.</p><p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they're probably the only folks around who might get the intracacies of what you're excited about)</p><p>We're looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you're a Senior Engineer - you've worked in server-side code for a few years. You've scaled to thousands or millions of users.  You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.</p><p>If you're a Junior engineer, you love to code and you're good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited.  (New grads please apply!)</p><p>Android and IOS engineers:</p><p>You have apps in the store you can show us.

Since being founded in 2009 by recent Cambridge and UCL graduates who noticed a gap in the market when making their own leavers' yearbook, we have had considerable success: over the past two years our sales have grown more than tenfold and we are now the market leader in the UK. After a particularly successful academic year in 2012-2013, we\u2019re expanding our development team and are now looking for an ambitious Junior / Graduate Developer to help us to continue to grow.</p><p>Your job will involve working on many different aspects of our software and technology systems. We\u2019ve managed to automate a highly complex design process, allowing us to create customised book layouts at the push of a button. This has involved bringing together many of the latest and most exciting software technologies and combining them in new ways to build a genuinely innovative piece of engineering. While we won\u2019t expect you to understand it all straight away, you\u2019ll be given the freedom to work on whichever parts of the system most interest you, and will be supported by the rest of the development team in learning the best practices of modern software engineering. This will include opportunities to get involved with: front-end development using the latest OOP JavaScript frameworks, back-end development, DevOps and automated server provisioning using Chef and Vagrant, automated testing, continuous integration and automated layout design.</p><p>Working at Yearbook Machine is not the corporate grind: we\u2019re a small group of like-minded, focused individuals working to create a product we genuinely believe in. We work hard but our environment is relaxed and friendly. Our office is based in a light and airy converted warehouse in central Shoreditch, which we share with another design startup. We're currently a team of just 6 people, 5 of whom are developers.</p><p>Requirements</p><p></p><pre><code>  - 2:1 above in Computer Science or other similarly technical degree subject\n  - Experience with OOP and at least some knowledge of modern software development paradigms such as MVC\n  - A genuine passion for technology: we\u2019ll be interested to see what you\u2019ve been doing in your spare time!\n</code></pre>\nBenefits<p></p><pre><code>  - Highly competitive, above-market salary\n  - Generous stock options\n  - The best equipment: Your choice of computer and monitor(s) and a comfortable chair\n  - Job satisfaction: we make a product that is fun to build and that our customers love!\n</code></pre>\nTo apply, please email your CV and cover letter to jobs@yearbookmachine.com with the subject \u201cGraduate / Junior PHP Developer\u201d</font>",

Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.</p><p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover.
