It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.

If you enjoy constantly getting to play with new tools, come help us connect to... everything.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

Although this group of 4 has a great deal of industry experience, we&#x27;ve only worked together in this capacity for about a year.  This means that there&#x27;s still a lot of opportunity and green-field work ahead of us.<p>The position could be described as a Sr. Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.  We work with billions of records per day and small hundreds of thousands of (messy!) features.  We primarily use Scala&#x2F;Spark and Python, but we employ R, Ruby, plain old SQL and other tools on a regular basis.<p>We&#x27;d like to find someone familiar with Bayesian systems, Random Forest and other classification.  Experience in ad-tech, e-commerce or online retail is a plus, but we strongly favor hiring someone with the right qualities that transcend mere familiarity.<p>More than anything we value sound judgement.  It&#x27;s great if you have loads of tools in in your tool belt, but you really have to know when it makes sense to use them.  As you get involved with research or optimization work, we want to have confidence that you&#x27;ll have the right intuition about what questions to pursue and what questions to defer.  With our high transaction volume, hundreds of unique models in production and hundreds of thousands of potential features, discernment is an essential virtue.  We&#x27;ll always have 5x more questions and curiosities than we&#x27;ll have time to chase down.  We&#x27;re looking for that person whose judgement is guided by experience possesses a knack for uncovering valuable, actionable insights.<p>Within our team I lean strongly toward the engineering side of the spectrum, but I&#x27;d be happy to have a conversation about our work.  dlarsen@connexity.com  If you&#x27;re more comfortable going the typical HR route, you can find the posting here: connexity.com&#x2F;open-positions",

The global supply chain is one the world&#x27;s largest economic engines, but it struggles to keep up with its own complexity.<p>The manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that make up this complex network are limited by the information they posses. They struggle to track and respond to supply and demand as their product travels from production to consumer. Those who try rely on 40-year-old data standards, lots of manual Excel work, and hordes of human middleware.<p>At Alloy, we\u2019re set to change all this. We provide the first comprehensive, low-latency view of demand and inventory across all distribution channels. Our platform connects manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and retailers, allowing companies to track their products down to the store shelf and better respond to end-consumer demand.<p>We are post-revenue, well funded by leading VCs, and winning contracts from well known brands. Our small team has diverse backgrounds and experience in analytics, large-scale enterprise SaaS, and retail and financial technology. Culture really matters to us: we value diversity in all forms and strive to foster integrity, respect, and open communication.<p>We&#x27;re committed to make enterprise software inspiring. We use Google Cloud Platform, Postgres, Redis, Python, Java and React, all wrapped in strong design.<p>== About You ==<p>You thrive in a small team where you can build technology from the ground up. You love to pick up new tech, get good at it fast and do something creative with it.<p>You don\u2019t shy away from even the most challenging problems and are relentless in always looking for better solutions. You are self-motivated and enjoy working with others towards a common objective. Building software is the means to an end: you want to change the way an entire industry operates.<p>As an engineer at Alloy, you\u2019ll do any or all of the following:<p>* Model parts of the supply chain and develop features that bring them together<p>* Automate the collection, parsing, and storage of huge volumes of data<p>* Design a flexible but blazing-fast analytics framework that powers instant insights<p>* Build beautiful, easy-to-use apps that our customers love to use<p>* Dive into server provisioning, deployment, automation, and monitoring<p>We would love to hear from you - send me a note at evan@alloy.ai",

Jane Street\u2019s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

Take out your phone, snap a pic of the problem, and within 20 seconds a tutor will help you out via chat.

Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d.
