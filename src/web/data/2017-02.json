It&#x27;s a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.<p>Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.\nPlease apply on our site to learn more about us and our growing team of 18!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hustle.life&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;hustle.life&#x2F;</a>",

We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet for about a year, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had.

With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code? Visit Open Source @ Jane Street (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;</a>), where you&#x27;ll find several OCaml libraries that we&#x27;ve released into the wild. These form the basis for all of our software, and we hope they make life better for some non-Jane-Street OCaml developers as well.<p>If you&#x27;re not yet convinced, feel free to poke around our benefits page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;</a>).

You have a solid understanding of how web apps are built and how the whole stack from IP to React fits together. You\u2019re aware of the state of the art of the industry, in things such as the SOLID principles, the ports and adapters pattern, and the various agile methodologies.<p>\u25e6 Balancing conflicting priorities: we want a product that is well engineered but not over-engineered. We have existing bugs, a long feature list, and new projects we\u2019d like to start. We have new technologies and techniques we want to make use of.<p>\u25e6 Clear communication: you can work closely with others and help your team communicate with the wider business. You\u2019ll be able to form strong working relationships with the rest of the technical leadership team, the product team, and delivery manager. You know how to help your team participate in practices like sprint planning, estimation, retrospectives, and squads&#x2F;cross-functional teams.<p>\u25e6 In the lead role, experience of coaching other developers, sharing best practice as well as either having experience of or a desire to lead a small team of developers.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has a fair bit of Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know one of these or be able to pick them up.<p>We work pretty generally, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: React, iOS, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience. We\u2019re committed to everyone\u2019s professional development, so we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending training courses or other events, as well as brown bag talks and Kaizen weeks for self-improvement and experimentation.

You help us build the infrastructure, our tutors teach the kids, the kids get better grades[1], relieve anxiety, and become better humans.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a high school kid and you can&#x27;t do your homework. Take out your phone, snap a pic of the problem, and within 20 seconds a tutor will help you out via chat. You talk to the tutor for however long it takes[2], and by the end of the session you&#x27;ve learned how to solve those kinds of problems. Your life is now better.<p>Here&#x27;s where you come in:<p>We need engineers to help us build the product. It&#x27;s been just four of us so far and we need help. I&#x27;ve personally built large swathes of the infrastructure, primarily the tutor side, and I need your help. On the immediate, you can help me move the rest of our codebase from Backbone to React. We&#x27;re halfway there :)<p>Another imminent project is rebuilding the messaging infrastructure, making student&#x2F;tutor matching smarter, moving the backend to a microservice model. All the things you&#x27;d expect to do in a startup moving from small to bigger.<p>Why Yup:<p>We&#x27;re not just a Silicon Valley startup trying to get big fast and loose. Our goal is to build a product that helps people, has sound unit economics, and generates real revenue, not just users. Our BD branch is finding ways to bring Yup to underprivileged youths whose families couldn&#x27;t afford it on their own by selling it to schools.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with many startups before and, honestly, this is the only one that&#x27;s made me feel really good about what I&#x27;m building every day.<p>If you have questions, I&#x27;m on twitter and here as Swizec.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay.
