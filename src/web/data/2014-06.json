We\u2019re looking for senior firmware engineers to join the team!</p><p>The hard requirements are brief: 5+ years of writing code for embedded systems with experience leading projects. At Mindtribe we code most often in C. In addition to technical work, our senior engineers plan projects, lead teams of engineers, and mentor junior members.</p><p>At this point, you can tackle most technical challenges that come your way. The rest you could figure out given enough time. You\u2019re starting to grow into someone who can elevate an entire team \u2013 not just by adding engineering horsepower, but by multiplying the abilities of those around you. You could probably get a job anywhere you want. Why Mindtribe?</p><p>As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That\u2019s how we know there\u2019s nowhere else we\u2019d rather be.</p><p>Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working at Mindtribe is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Mindtribers are not just versatile within their own fields \u2013 \u201cfirmware\u201d engineers work with everything from 8-bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones \u2013 we also have EE\u2019s driving SolidWorks, ME\u2019s developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCB\u2019s. You\u2019ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you\u2019ll get better at it each time.</p><p>Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we\u2019ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren\u2019t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it\u2019s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. We\u2019re constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.</p><p>Mindtribe succeeds by putting forward strong teams with sound methods. While we consider ourselves talented engineers, relying on heroic individual efforts to meet impossible deadlines is a painful way to squeak by. Instead, our edge comes from constant introspection about how we do engineering, and we are always looking for ways to improve. Things that are broken here don\u2019t stay that way for long.</p><p>We\u2019re a small company. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the entire organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.</p><p>Mindtribe is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at the epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. We enjoy working together and place great value in maintaining an awesome company environment. \u2018Tribers regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that\u2019s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the new Exploratorium.</p><p>For more information about us, check out our team (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mindtribe.com/team</a>), our portfolio (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio</a>), and our method (<a href=\"http://www.mindtribe.com/method\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mindtribe.com/method</a>).</p><p>If this is resonating, we\u2019d love to get to know you! Please drop us a line at nopnjmp@mindtribe.com to tell us how you\u2019ve demonstrated leadership in your career and why you\u2019d be excited to do what we do.</p></font>",

If you have worked on a production web site with meaningful traffic and customers, know at least 3 programming languages and are comfortable writing unit tests then we want to talk to you.</p><p>Are you opinionated and diplomatic? Most people are one or the other. All major decisions are made democratically, and we do code reviews on every pull request to keep quality high. You need to be able to express your opinions in as objective a manner as possible, and be able to accept and learn from constructive criticism. There's always a better way to do something.</p><p>Are you working on personal projects / your own startup? You'll need to be a self-starter to get on at Rainforest, because we'll give you a lot of freedom and almost no hand-holding.</p><p>DESIGNERS WHO CODE</p><p>Design is at the heart of everything we do. We fundamentally believe that great design - meaning usability, simplicity and elegance - is core to our competitive advantage, and one of the most important ways we can work toward our mission of making developers happier and more productive.</p><p>We are proponents of noPSD design (so much so that we wrote a blog post about our process). To that end you should at the very least be comfortable with mocking up your designs in HTML and CSS, and ideally be able to own the entire front-end process of shipping a new feature, from conception through user research, to design and build, and iterating based on usage metrics and qualitative feedback.</p><p>We know we're looking for a unicorn, so if you feel like you're an excellent front-end hacker whose design chops are a bit rusty you should still get in touch. Design is all about iteration, and we already have a great designer on our team who can help you grow as a designer.</p><p>DEV OPS</p><p>We're looking for an exceptional DevOps engineer to join as the next member of Rainforest. We're still a very small team, but people usually think we're much bigger given the scale at which we operate.</p><p>One of the more technically complex parts of our infrastructure is managing a large stack of virtual machines. Every single test run through Rainforest is done through a newly minted VM. This means that we boot thousands of machines every single day. Given our current growth, we expect this to grow exponentially.</p><p>Here's what we hope to get out of you: You're not afraid of writing code, our stack is Ruby, so you'll have to either know it or be ready to learn it. You need to have prior experience with a provisioning tool (Puppet, Chef, etc). You understand systems and networks thoroughly. You know things we don't about distributed systems.</p><p>We're working on super hard problems that make developers' lives easier. We are a group of friends that love what we're working on, and believe that we're going to change the world for people building software.</p><p>DATA NERD</p><p>We run a lot of tests here at Rainforest. We record everything that testers do to execute each test. Clicks, text entry, submission times, answers, screenshots\u2026 everything. Alongside that, we have fine-grained metrics on our testers, where they are from, what time they log into the system, how often they test with Rainforest. That's a lot of data and we could do so much more with it.</p><p>We're looking for someone to help us do that. Your role will be to use this data to improve the quality of the results we return to our customers, detect fraud, resolve disputes, generate tests automatically and many many other things.</p><p>We're looking for someone with a strong background in data science, statistics and supervised learning. You'll also need to be able to write code to productize your work. Most importantly, you should be able to own your projects and see them through to improving the lives of our customers. This role would probably be perfect for academics who want to get into a small team that moves fast and ships software every day.</p><p>Apply via our website! <a href=\"https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/</a></p></font>",

Strong engineering; thoughtful design and clean code. Graphics, browser, games, or animation experience a big plus.\nA front-end engineer that has a strong computer science background, but wants to focus on product engineering rather than backend systems. You don\u2019t want to just take off the shelf UI components, but want to explore new interactions. You aren\u2019t afraid to dig under the hood of iOS frameworks or browser code in order to make an animation or interaction feel natural and smooth.</p><p>=============</p><p>Backend Engineer at Prismatic: <a href=\"http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976</a></p><p>==</p><p>Prismatic is a great place to be a backend engineer - we analyze millions of shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown, lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine. We are looking to grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.\nWe are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine learning, designing and building new product features). We\u2019re a small team, so you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts. Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don\u2019t expect you to either. We do, however, expect the following:\n- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\nHere\u2019s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</p></font>",

TrueVault stores healthcare data from mobile health apps, wearable devices and even genomic research so that our customers don\u2019t need to spend their precious time worrying about security, performance and scalability. More than just a database as a service, TrueVault\u2019s proprietary technology allows us to secure our customers' data better than anyone else can (hint: think encryption and global scale slice distribution).</p><p>Our mission is to provide the simplest, most secure way for web apps, mobile apps and even wearable devices to store sensitive data.

That's why we are looking for incredible people (like you perhaps?) to join us.</p><p>Who is TrueVault?</p><p>TrueVault is a Y Combinator graduated startup based in SoMa San Francisco. We have an incredible group of investors including Paul Buchheit, Mark Pincus, and Bill Tai who have invested more than $3 million dollars because they deeply believe in our mission. We are a group of engineers passionate about data security, API performance and building products that developers like us love to use. We are looking for a handful of engineering MacGyvers to join our founding team.</p><p>Why Join TrueVault?</p><p>Because at TrueVault, you will have the opportunity to work in arguably the biggest market opportunity of this coming decade, improve the collection, portability and security of really critical data, and push the envelop of data portability forward. You\u2019ll work on things that haven't been done before.

If you take pride in what you do and care about the people who use the product you\u2019ll find people just like you here. If you want to open source and share what you\u2019ve built with the world at TrueVault you can.  But most importantly, if you want to work with other incredible minds and welcome the challenges of doing things that\u2019ve never been done, then we want you to join us.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",

This team is responsible for developing and maintaining the software and systems that power our websites, mobile applications, and marketing.</p><p>A few things about us:</p><p>* We try to use the right tool for the right job; maybe a shell script, maybe multiple Storm topologies communicating via RabbitMQ and reading data from internal web services. And while we have found some tools that work, we're always willing to incorporate new ones if they give us a new way of tackling a problem.</p><p>* We know that engineering is all about understanding tradeoffs, not applying the same solution over and over again to every problem.</p><p>* Sometimes we get to work with fun new tools (Scala, Clojure, Storm, Elastic Search), sometimes we work with old standards (Java, Python, Bash). Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.</p><p>* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job. We are responsible for what we put out in the world, including monitoring and maintainence.</p><p>A few things about you:</p><p>* You're an engineer, but you know how to think like an operations person.</p><p>* You cut your teeth in open source software, and know how to find documents, read the source, ask for help, and report a bug.</p><p>* You're excited about glamorous work, but you're willing to sometimes do shit work, because in the end somebody has do it.</p><p>If this sounds interesting and you think you'd be a good match, or if you're interested in learning the skills to become a good match, please get in touch with Andrew Turley (aturley@theladders.com).</p></font>",

We built Sooloos because we wanted its features for ourselves: the ability to browse huge music libraries and stream audio to multiple rooms. We built touchscreen kiosks and put them in our friends' houses and in our favorite bars. We kept our day jobs, but in our own time we relentlessly pursued the world's coolest music listening experience.</p><p>After a few years, we were surprised that other products in the space were still unable to meet our needs, so we turned our hobby into a company and shipped our first product in 2006. We built our own hardware using studio-grade audio components and packaged Sooloos as a high-end music server for the audiophile market, which received us with open arms.</p><p>In late 2008 we were acquired by Meridian Audio, which had a culture of innovation in audio hardware and DSP that matched our own in UX and streaming. In addition to manufacturing the gold standard of high-performance multi-zone music solutions, we also develop software music products for Jaguar Land Rover, Hewlett Packard, and a variety of audio OEMs.</p><p>Five years post acquisition, everyone on our original development team is still with us. Our reference product serves a community of 10,000 specialty users, and we have 10 million activations and 1.5 million monthly actives for HP Connected Music, the product we bundle on nearly 20 million PCs annually. We work with the biggest services in the business including Last.fm, AllMusic Guide, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Spotify, 7digital, Songkick, Musicbrainz, LyricFind, and Qobuz.</p><p>Our team is headquartered in Meridian's New York office in Soho (home to the most amazing digital theater ever) but we routinely work remotely, sometimes on four continents at once. Our flat structure relies on the initiative and accountability of everyone on the team; we all own projects (and in some cases product) and our output speaks for itself.</p><p>Please contact hiring@sooloos.com if you're interested</p></font>",

Our web-based interface allows educators to make data-driven decisions - regardless of previous technology experience. We also provide a mechanism for principals to deliver evaluation measures to teachers for real-time classroom feedback.</p><p>- Our backend engine provides mechanisms for automated data retrieval and sanitation, allowing the customer\u2019s data to remain fresh with no interaction needed.</p><p>- Launched in January 2013, we\u2019ve quickly become the data solution for roughly 50% of Mississippi public school districts and are currently migrating into other states.  We\u2019ve been revenue-driven and maintain profitability, which has made us attractive to potential funding sources and we\u2019re currently considering our options.</p><p>Who are you?</p><p>- You are a talented, enthusiastic programmer that can\u2019t wait to assist in the development of our backend engine and front-end interfaces.  Our core technologies include:</p><p>* Ruby as primary language on backend.  Due to lack of APIs on many third-party educational systems, data retrieval is often performed by various scraping methods.  Experience with Mechanize, Nokogiri, Watir, and the likes are the icing on your cake.</p><p>* Ruby\u2019s Padrino, a highly extensible framework built on Sinatra, is the glue connecting our backend to frontend.</p><p>* MongoDB, Redis, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, and Amazon Redshift provide our various data stores.</p><p>* Objective-C/UIKit powers our teacher evaluation instrument for iPad and you are totally okay with that.</p><p>* Angular.js on the frontend is something that makes you smile. Data visualizations created with Highcharts, D3, and Charts.js.</p><p>* By no means are we limited to the languages and technologies above.  Solutions from other areas are always welcome - as long as they play nice with others (Flash.)</p><p>What will we give you?</p><p>- Competitive salary with full health, vision, and dental benefits.</p><p>- Retirement plan (comparable to the big guys that have way more meetings) with company match that will make sure your cohabitating hamsters are well-cared for in their old age.</p><p>- Flexible vacation structure (meaning just tell us you\u2019re going out of town), including a company-provided condominium in Florida.  Yes, we have a condo.</p><p>What will you give us?</p><p>- Loyalty to the company goals as a whole and a desire to serve the greater good.</p><p>- Flexibility to perform outside of your specific role when it\u2019s needed, included talking with customers and attending trade shows from time to time.</p><p>- A good sense of humor - because nobody likes a boring job.</p><p>----</p><p>Contact us with questions, resume/CV, or portfolio at hack@schoolstatus.com</p></font>",

We\u2019re committed to helping each other learn and grow while having a blast, and we\u2019re looking for developers that are smart, ambitious, and get things done. We mostly work in Java, but you\u2019ll get bonus points for server/backend, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript, or machine learning experience. You\u2019ll get to design and develop large scale data processing systems, work alongside a talented set of peers, and make an impact beyond what is possible at a large, bureaucratic company.</p><p>We offer a highly competitive salary and stock compensation package, including 100% employee coverage for medical, dental, life, and disability insurance. We also provide lunch and a fully-stocked snack bar &amp; coffee station. To decompress, we play table tennis at the office, or volleyball at the beach (which is walking distance from our office!).</p><p>Placing the right people in the right jobs is hard, and since we took on this challenge, we've already helped hundreds of companies, from fledgling startups to the Fortune 100s, find and recruit the best talent.
