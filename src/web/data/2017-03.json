The $200+ billion legal industry is still stuck in the 20th century: paper-based, error-prone and slow. With rates averaging $300 &#x2F; hour, only 15% of Americans with serious legal problems even seek the help of a lawyer. For everyday issues like bogus cable bills, fewer than 1 in 1,000,000 of us seek justice, even though monopolists like Comcast rank in the 0th percentile for customer satisfaction. Class actions used to provide the necessary scale to combat certain widespread frauds, but over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has allowed businesses to eliminate them. The technical challenges are hard, ranging from automating the monitoring of corporate misconduct to crafting delightful user flows to building the leading database of outcomes in consumer disputes. In parallel with the software development, a team of Yale Law School alums conducts the deep research so that our users finally feel empowered, rather than intimidated, by the law.<p>We currently have a MVP (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.senddavid.com</a>) and are looking for a Senior Engineer as a very early member of the team.<p>Position: Senior Engineer | Salary: $80\u00ad-$125k | Equity: 1.0%-\u00ad4.0% | <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;david-174&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;72943-engineer</a><p>Contact us via Angel List or talent@senddavid.com",

The majority of this work revolves around developing Apache Mesos[1] and Aurora[2].<p>Aside from the constant challenge of making sure our platform can scale with the company (we have the largest Mesos clusters in the world), Twitter is in an exciting stage where efficiency (and thus hard performance problems) are becoming more and more important.<p>Because most of our platform is open sourced, contributions you make on this team will also be felt across a huge number of companies in the community. Mesos is used at companies like Apple and Netflix and Aurora adopters include Paypal, Uber and Electronic Arts. Twitter&#x27;s commitment to OSS as well as our unique position in terms of platform size gives us a huge opportunity to lead development of key features.<p>One of my favorite things about working on this team for the last few years has been that I get to touch literally every part of the stack. It&#x27;s a constant learning process. Mesos is written in C++ and is very heavy on systems, Aurora is on the JVM, much of our developer tooling and automation is in Python, and then we also have a product layer and other tooling that are written in a modern JS stack (React&#x2F;redux&#x2F;etc.). So no matter your interests, you can make a huge impact here.<p>From a product point of view - trying to keep thousands of developers happy and productive in the face of constant comparisons to public offerings like Heroku and AWS, as well as other platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. is also a huge (but fun) challenge. So if you&#x27;re a product-focused engineer, this is also a great opportunity.<p>We have a great team that&#x27;s based in SF and within six months will be completely onsite.

Product engineering at Hustle is unique in that we do not have mobile, front-end and backend specialists. Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack. This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle&#x27;s particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It&#x27;s a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.<p>Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

We work with over 200 awesome companies. Quality is key to our model -- we turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network. We&#x27;ve proudly bootstrapped and profitable.<p>As we scale, we\u2019ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities. In our view of the future, job candidates don\u2019t receive as much unsolicited outreach from recruiters. Job search is organized, and talented candidates have more high-quality options.<p>We use Python&#x2F;Flask, Javascript&#x2F;Node.js, PostgreSQL, Elastic Search, AWS. We&#x27;re also working on a project in Ruby&#x2F;Sinatra. And we&#x27;re big supporters of open source.<p>Link to Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underdogio\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;underdogio</a><p>Link to Medium post: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@cmuir&#x2F;lessons-from-sixteen-months-of-bootstrapping-at-underdog-io-6deb98344d31\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@cmuir&#x2F;lessons-from-sixteen-months-of-boo...</a><p>Email chris@underdog.io to apply.<p>Because we&#x27;re still a small team, we&#x27;re not able to accommodate recent bootcamp graduates.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

Most of our contracts are multi-year high-price affairs, so relationships are really important. Plus, you get to spend your time at breweries, distilleries and roasteries (I&#x27;ve personally never been to a sales meeting where beer or coffee wasn&#x27;t served freshly brewed).<p>Next Steps<p>Please submit something awesome to JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.",

Prior financial industry knowledge helpful but by no means required.<p>We are building, optimizing, and scaling high-frequency trading systems. It&#x27;s fun and challenging. We have a very open and collaborative culture and you will find yourself working closely with traders, quants, network and system engineers, and other devs. We release code nightly and generally have a quick iteration loop: your &#x27;clients&#x27; are frequently the coworkers sitting next to you, so you can work closely together to get to a solution. You&#x27;ll learn a lot, and hopefully we&#x27;ll learn a lot from you :)<p>I lead our dev onboarding team where we focus on getting you the knowledge and insight to be effective at IMC. Despite kicking up our growth rate, we regard a highly interactive and in-depth training and mentoring process to be critical to our growth. A typical day finds me reviewing a lot of code and discussing design and implementation with the rest of the team, as well as fostering the onboardees&#x27; relationships with the rest of the organization.<p>INTERNSHIPS: We\u2019ve found the best and most educational internship experiences come from working on production code.

We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code?

We focus on Search, Native &amp; Paid Social and offer some SEO and ABM.\nI am looking to make my first full-time hire and bring most of the outsourced work in-house.<p>The role requires a strong handle on SEM and Google Shopping best practices, with clarity about how to think about account structures and a unquenchable thirst for knowledge, experimentation and pushing the limits.<p>Initially, the role will require account management, client communication, report creation and account build outs, restructures and optimization.<p>I need someone very well rounded for this initial hire, but hope to build a team around and under them, so the role will become more defined and focused over time.<p>I need someone who excels at asking the right questions of clients to help develop a truly unique strategy for them.<p>Our main differentiator is deep targeting strategy. We consistently hear from our clients that they never heard ideas like ours from the other agencies they speak to. This is core to our offering. A deeper, more meaningful understanding of the clients, their goals, and their internal decision making processes and mapping that to the channels we are using to deliver a strategy that truly moves the specific needle that needs moving.<p>Must haves:<p><pre><code>  \u2022 A clear understanding of all the available levers within Adwords and AdCenter.\n\n  \u2022 Clear understanding of Google Shopping strategy, ideally with experience segmenting campaigns by search query intent.\n\n  \u2022 Semi-Technical - Know enough to troubleshoot tracking problems, manipulate an XML data feed, tweak css, tweak adwords scripts (javascript, etc... The more technical the better, but a bare minimum of being able to google an issue and troubleshoot it on your own if necessary. \n\n  \u2022 Experience with Excel - Specifically, Index Match, Pivot Tables, Vlookups, etc... A HUGE plus is someone with VBA experience,and using tools like Supermetrics in Excel. \n\n  \u2022 Some knowledge of statistics is important. \n\n  \u2022 Experience using Google Analytics, setting up custom reports, and building many different audience segments for retargeting. \n\n  \u2022 Experience using Unbounce is important.\n\n  \u2022 The ability to tell a compelling story from data. \n\n  \u2022 Strong communication skills.\n</code></pre>\nEmail david@davidmelamed and let\u2019s chat!",

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We\u2019re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago. We\u2019re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they\u2019re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you\u2019re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>",

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode, is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay.
