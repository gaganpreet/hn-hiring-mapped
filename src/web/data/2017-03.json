It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of just over 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 16 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

And there has been an alarming rise in the number of seniors who are homeless or relying on food banks.<p>In New York City, the number of seniors is projected to increase to nearly 1.9 million by 2030, making it the fastest-growing population.

The Muse mobile app teaches users how to meditate while giving them real-time feedback on how they are doing. It helps to solve some fundamental difficulties with learning to meditate, such as: &quot;how do I do it?&quot;, &quot;how do I know if I am doing it right?&quot;, and &quot;how do I stay motivated?&quot;.

Product engineering at Hustle is unique in that we do not have mobile, front-end and backend specialists. Instead engineers are empowered to develop and ship features in their entirety covering the whole stack. This feature of product development is enabled by Hustle&#x27;s particular technology choices: the use of JavaScript, React, React Native and Node.js through out the stack. It&#x27;s a stack that heavily rewards generalists that just want to ship things. It also makes for a very dynamic working environment: form a temporary team for a larger project where you decide to focus on shipping a polished mobile frontend and for the next project form another temporary team where you would focus on delivering a humming backend.<p>Hustle was started by engineers from Facebook and MongoDB and is backed by top VC firms including Social Capital and Index Ventures.

We are a global liquidity provider and market maker, operating around the clock and around the globe, employing over 500 people in our offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.<p>It\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re big believers in functional programming; OCaml, a statically typed functional language, is our primary development platform. Jane Street\u2019s technology group is small by design, which means we need to maximize the productivity of each person we hire. We believe functional programming (and specifically, OCaml) helps us do that. But it\u2019s not about productivity alone: programming in a rich and expressive language like OCaml is just more fun. We\u2019re also happy to spend time and money on making it easier for the people here to get things done. This ranges from big projects, like the work we do on development tools (e.g. Iron, our in-house code review and release management system, and Merlin, a tool for providing IDE-like features for OCaml), to little touches, like getting people whatever crazy keyboard will help them get their work done most comfortably.<p>Want to see some of our code? Visit Open Source @ Jane Street (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;janestreet.github.io&#x2F;</a>), where you&#x27;ll find several OCaml libraries that we&#x27;ve released into the wild. These form the basis for all of our software, and we hope they make life better for some non-Jane-Street OCaml developers as well.<p>If you&#x27;re not yet convinced, feel free to poke around our benefits page (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;benefits&#x2F;</a>).

Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial cloud (Pivotal Web Services).<p>Cloud R&amp;D is also responsible for Pivotal Tracker and Spring.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop.

We&#x27;re changing that, and we need your help.<p>Our first product is Gocap: a connected device that integrates seamlessly into a user&#x27;s workflow to collect data on insulin doses. Dose information is combined with blood glucose readings collected by our app and sent to our backend. There it empowers healthcare providers to make treatment decisions based on thousands of data points rather than the single reading they use today. This requires well-built software at all levels of the stack: device firmware, mobile apps, backend data storage and processing, frontend web portals, and a variety of tools to support building and testing the physical devices our team designs.
