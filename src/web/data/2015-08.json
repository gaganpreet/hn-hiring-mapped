It turns out there\u2019s a lot more to fix. And it\u2019s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government.<p>Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, it\u2019s about $70M less per year to operate.<p>People die because the Veteran&#x27;s Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures. [0]<p>That\u2019s not because there\u2019s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.<p>Our team is 10 people (Stanford, Google, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.<p>We\u2019re looking for:<p>* experienced full-stack engineers<p>* experienced devops engineers<p>* a product manager with a technical background<p>* a hyper-resourceful operations person<p>We have a social mission (we just incorporated as a public benefit corporation), but we pay market compensation (above market, for DC) and equity (above market).<p>If you&#x27;d like to build software and infrastructure that radically improves how our government serves people, we\u2019d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com<p>^Not in DC &#x2F; able to relocate, but intrigued and in SF?

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive: that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past. At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems. We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely). We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house). Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure!\nE-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill)",

Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community\n</code></pre>\nWhat we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data\n</code></pre>\nFor a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk I gave at Clojure&#x2F;West. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.<p>Does this sound like something you&#x27;re into?

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three years, we\u2019re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (17M kids), and 39,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 70 (30 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

Our fast-growing network is quickly becoming the platform of choice for large employers and third-party administrators, and we\u2019re already helping over 1M employees make better and more cost-effective healthcare decisions.<p>A few key details:\n- We\u2019re well-funded and stable: we offer great salaries, medical&#x2F;dental&#x2F;vision coverages, and generous bonuses. \n- We\u2019re off to great start. Our platform is already in use by millions, and we\u2019re just getting started. \n- We set you up for success: We never skimp on the best hardware or tools money can buy.\n- We want you to share in our success. Every offer includes a healthy dose of stock options.\n- We\u2019re building for the long-term. Our key executives have been around the block, and understand the importance (and sustainability) of true work-life balance.",

We allow hundreds of thousands of employees to access, analyze and take action on large amounts of customer data in real time. We are still a small engineering team, only about 50 or so of us, thus everyone counts.<p>Dividing our codebase into independent microservices will make it easier for new engineers to get up to speed, enable much faster deployments of new code (by the engineers themselves) and make it easier and cheaper to scale with much better resiliency.<p>Despite the popularity of microservice architectures, and plethora of available frameworks, there are still many unsolved problems (especially around RPC performance, storage and freely moving processes around) in operating at scale in production. We not only want to solve these for ourselves, but share our findings and tools with the wider community.<p>We are using a blend of the best tech out there: Docker for containerization; Aurora&#x2F;Mesos for data center &#x2F; server management; CEPH for fully redundant storage and putting it together in a way we haven&#x27;t seen anyone else do. Check out this presentation we held at a recent Docker meetup (hosted by us) for how we are going about it:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.meetup.com&#x2F;10524692&#x2F;Relocatable%20Docker%20Containers%20with%20CEPH.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.meetup.com&#x2F;10524692&#x2F;Relocatable%20Docker%20Cont...</a><p>Please send me a note at kristian@medallia.com if any of the above sounds interesting to you.<p>Kristian Eide,\nSoftware Architect",

We operate mainly in the European and the Asian markets, with all the challenges that include, for example: different alphabets, different levels of literacy among our users, and different experience levels with internet usage and technology.<p>Our implementation \nWe use Java a lot. As we are creating login, user-management, and payment applications, we use HTML forms a lot too. Our older applications are built with Jersey&#x2F;JAX-RS (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jersey.java.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jersey.java.net&#x2F;</a>), while our new ones are built with Spark (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparkjava.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparkjava.com&#x2F;</a>). We try to keep the code-base to a minimum. On the frontend we use plain JavaScript (inline) for code that has to be executed right away, and jQuery for \u201cnice to have\u201d functionality. We use Apache Velocity for templating. We build using Maven and Grunt, and we track our code using Git. Performance is key, and our aim is that our applications should be ready to use (or at least be perceived as being ready to use) within a second, even on slow connections. \nWe have (big) databases too, but you won\u2019t have to interact with them directly. Persistence is handled by an API created by another team.<p>Who we are looking for \nWe need more hands on Java&#x2F;Web. This means we need someone who would be comfortable with working with Java, Jersey, Spark, Apache Velocity and JavaScript&#x2F;jQuery. And Maven&#x2F;Grunt for building. We are not looking for someone who is already an expert on all of these things (It would be nice, though), but someone who knows a few and is willing and able to learn the rest.<p>Deadline for application:30&#x2F;08&#x2F;2015<p>Contact info: Tina Tan  (+47) 90894741",

Our proposition to them is simple: Pixlee offers a unique opportunity to thrive and grow rapidly in a small-team startup environment operating at big-company scale. Our customers are some of the largest brands in the world and everything you do here affects millions of consumers.<p>For me, I&#x27;ve really felt that I&#x27;ve been able to really grow very rapidly, and also been given the autonomy to make many decisions you can&#x27;t make at a much larger startup. Its a very tight knit group, and we like to have fun.<p>We believe in using the right technology for the task, and we use a mix of rails, backbone, python, scala, elasticsearch, and postgres.<p>Engineering openings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlee.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;66247\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlee.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;66247</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlee.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70151\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixlee.workable.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;70151</a> Other: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixlee.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixlee.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>You can also email a resume&#x2F;portfolio to dennis[at]pixleeteam.com",

We\u2019re a pretty small team (currently 14 people) so you\u2019ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.<p>We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We\u2019re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we\u2019re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We\u2019re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time). In addition we\u2019re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.<p>---<p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local. We offer an integrated social, web, and email marketing solution designed to help merchants get more customers and keep them coming back by spreading word of mouth, extending their customer service, managing their online reputation, and leveraging the Main Street Hub\u2019s merchant network.

In our view of the future, job candidates don\u2019t receive unsolicited outreach from recruiters and companies don\u2019t pay placement fees for the vast majority of their hires.

Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites.

In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>Our team is sharp and works well together.

More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out.

Exciting challenges at huge scale and high speed!<p>If this is you or who you want to be, we want to hear from you:<p>We want coders that are challenged by complex problems in distributed environments, but value simplicity in their solutions. We want software designers that look at the entire system and think like engineers - you look for data to validate your assumptions, you create tests to verify your implementations, you know your tools, and you look for opportunities to automate everything. You want to learn how all the parts work together - you want to know what it takes to run your code in a global production environment as much as you care about writing and debugging it.<p>You have a M.Sc in Computer Science or equivalent experience, and have worked with various programming languages, like Java, Go, Scala, C++ or Python. You are excited by distributed systems, cloud computing, and service-oriented architectures. You keep your code in a version control system, possibly distributed like git or mercurial, and you use more than your brain to keep track of your ideas and bugs. We don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve used the technologies we\u2019re currently working with before. We DO care that you think they\u2019re cool and something you want to work with.<p>We want smart people who will fight for their point of view because we\u2019re often wrong, we just don\u2019t like admitting it. We want co-workers who want to constantly learn new things and are capable of fluidly moving between projects.

We&#x27;re looking to hire a new security engineer. Simple is a subsidiary of BBVA Compass that seeks to add superior engineering and transparent policies to the banking world. We&#x27;ve been around since 2009 and we have about 260 employees.<p>Our security group is split into two teams - Security Operations and Security Governance. SecOps builds security software and features for our customers and employees (like two-factor authentication) and Security Governance performs security assessments on our existing and pre-release software. You would be joining me on the Security Governance team, doing web and mobile penetration tests, source code review and incident response.<p>In this role, you&#x27;ll be working through different parts of our frontend, backend and internal software and breaking it any and every way you can. You&#x27;ll be working closely with the software engineering teams as a resident security authority. You&#x27;ll also be checking IDS logs and working with tools like ThreatStack, CrowdStrike, Suricata, etc. Prior experience with those exact tools is helpful but not necessary, we&#x27;ll get you up to speed regardless. More important is the ability to find real security flaws in applications and spot problems with source code.<p>This is an ideal job for those who are technically competent and tired of working as a security consultant (however, you do not need to have been a consultant, we will consider virtually any background as long as you have solid skills).<p>Some report writing will be required for you to document and track vulnerabilities, but you will not be using pages and pages of methodology or vulnerability diagram boilerplate. Most reports are about a page with a much simpler template, and posted right to GitHub. You&#x27;ll be doing more direct communication with engineers via IRC or Zoom about vulnerabilities you find than you will be writing a report about it.<p>Speaking of GitHub, we use it for everything. Even our HR and marketing teams use GitHub. We are a very engineering-heavy organization. We also offer a lot of support for remote employees - I work fully remote from NYC. We use a private IRC server and Slack for chat, Zoom for video conferencing and we even have two Double Robotics robots in our office to remote into.<p>Finally, our tech stack consists of mostly Scala and Java on the backend and mostly JavaScript and Ruby on the frontend. We also use Python, R, Clojure and C for certain tools. People are free to write in whatever they want as long as it&#x27;s effective. We also use AWS.<p>You can see the full, slightly more HR&#x27;d job description here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;banksimple.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;b9GKYw&#x2F;Information-Security-Governance-Engineer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;banksimple.theresumator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;b9GKYw&#x2F;Information-...</a><p>Feel free to shoot me an email at dsaccomanni@simple.com, I&#x27;ll be glad to talk more about the company or the role.

In the tech industry, we have been on the receiving end of some killer productivity apps. Some of our favorites include Asana, Yammer and Slack. These apps have completely changed the way we work\u2026 unless you\u2019re part of the half of the economy that doesn\u2019t sit at a desk. Try using these apps 100% of the time on a mobile device and you\u2019ll likely grow frustrated. Worse yet, these apps were imagined using the use cases of product managers and engineers, not bartenders, hotel workers, contractors or similar jobs. The existing apps are just too hard to use and fundamentally miss on solving the problems workers in these industries face.<p>Crew tries to take what we\u2019ve learned about productivity for desk-bound workers and make that more compatible for other industries. Crew currently consists of multiple \u201cmodules\u201d: Messaging\u200a\u2014\u200aBefore using Crew, many of our users were using a mix of text messages and emails, with some using consumer messaging apps like WhatsApp and GroupMe. Crew makes messaging much easier by allowing a manager to add employees to a central directory, enabling employees to communicate without trading phone numbers (both a convenience and actually a safety concern in some companies). Scheduling\u200a\u2014\u200aCoordination around shifts is one of the top concerns in the businesses of many of our customers. Employees have shift schedules which can vary from week to week and employers get burned when shifts are busted (no-shows). Crew makes it easy to post the shift schedule and then coordinate shift swapping when necessary. Task Management\u200a\u2014\u200aDid you know that many restaurants have a \u201cchore board\u201d in the back? An actual chalkboard or piece of paper posted letting everyone know what has to get done today. Tasks replaces the chore board with a ticketing system.<p>We have new modules currently under development but what we\u2019ve released thus far has already received a warm reception. Despite only having been available since April, Crew is growing very fast and is frequently ranked in the top 100 Business apps on both Google Play and iTunes. The traction we\u2019ve gotten has helped us raise a seed round. Our backend is a highly automated deployment in EC2 that utilizes auto scaling along with many AWS features. Currently our client consist of an iOS, Android and Webapp utilizing a common infrastructure to communicate. The communication and data infrastructure is written in Node.js and Java (Spring) with heavy reliance on Mongo, Redis and ActiveMQ. This stack allows us to meet our goal of having a linear scalable application that targets zero downtime. The webapp is a Node.js Express application that utilizes Backbone, Require.js and Bootstrap to deliver a responsive and highly performant experience.",

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly.\nAs an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>\u25e6 <i>skill</i>: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>\u25e6 <i>desire to learn</i>: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>\u25e6 <i>understanding</i>: our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>\u25e6 <i>clear communication</i>: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.\nSpeaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.\nSo, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia this fall...want to join us?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).
