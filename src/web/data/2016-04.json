It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 100 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  In particular, we\u2019re looking for senior engineers and engineering managers: empathetic leaders who are excited about teaching, coaching and professional development.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>",

Unfortunately not every business have the data they need.  Conversely many companies have large data sets that they are aren&#x27;t getting the full potential value out of.

We are looking for people to join us to achieve this goal.<p>This is the first full-time hire at the company and the role would be employee #2 after the founder.  As such this person needs to to be willing to walk into a situation with a lot of big challenges as well as uncountable unknowns.<p>An early version of our backend infrastructure is already in production, but we&#x27;re looking to quickly expand the feature set while maintaining a highly reliable and scalable platform.\nWhere are we today?<p>Today&#x27;s data collection platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services.  All backend code is written in Scala using open source technologies like Jetty, Apache Thrift, Kafka, and ZooKeeper.<p>What is next?<p>While we think this is a good start there are already some pressing architectural needs that need to be addressed to make the platform truly scalable.  These include the design and implementation of our next generation core infrastructure, migration of data from our legacy systems,  and building out our data analytics framework.

In the last 6 weeks, the rewrite has generated work that will lead to us open-sourcing 3 (hopefully useful) npm modules.<p>We consume the exact same APIs as the mobile apps and enforce isomorphic-ity by testing that the app can run entirely without its server-side, the Web server side is used purely for assist: code&#x2F;assets distribution and caching, pre-rendering, redirecting urls for legacy and prettiness etc. Some engineering values important to us: statelessness breed good logic, good constraints breed good software design.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Moving between divisions, temporarily or permanently, is possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica LA, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Sydney, Berlin, Singapore and Beijing, with more coming.<p>We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. You&#x27;ll probably learn more, more quickly, than any other time in your career. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

This means helping to form a healthy and happy culture. We strive to be respectful of each other&#x27;s time and point of view. We&#x27;re learning how to do this together. We want to create a place where it&#x27;s OK to fail, and that you know the team has your back the whole way through.\n* Self-motivated. To us that means when you get an interesting problem, you will rip into it until you understand its nuances and perhaps have a glimpse of the solution.\n* Empathy. We work closely with our customers, meaning phone calls, emails, and sometimes lunch. It is important in this job to listen to them so that we can build what they need and want.\n* Knowledge of AWS would be excellent.\n* UX experience (or interest in cultivating it) would be excellent.<p>Send an email to jobs@snapdocs.com telling us about yourself.

They&#x27;re smart people who are highly capable of working with numbers, but they don&#x27;t necessarily understand databases or all the ways they can use data to get the answers they need.<p>Of course, you&#x27;ll also need strong enough programming chops and sufficient understanding of dimensional modeling and data pipelines (in a Linux ecosystem, and ideally AWS) to design and implement from scratch an OLAP database and the ETL processing to populate it.<p>You&#x27;ll be expected to work independently and manage your own work.  We&#x27;re a very small engineering team, and each member is almost entirely self-managing -- we can&#x27;t afford a lot of process overhead, let alone micromanagement. You&#x27;ll have a team of intelligent, deeply technical engineers to talk things through with, but no one else on the team will be working directly on the same projects, and none of us have a deep background in the technologies and processes you&#x27;re implementing.<p>It&#x27;s not a requirement, but the ideal candidate would also be comfortable with enough web development to be able to jump into our front-end (JS w&#x2F; Backbone and React) and back-end (Python&#x2F;Django) codebases to add and adjust event tracking code as needed without having to wait for the web team.  If you can contribute to building, maintaining, optimizing, and automating our development processes, that&#x27;d be another awesome bonus.<p>Oh, right, we need some buzzwords... try these: data warehousing, business intelligence, analytics, OLAP, ETL, dimensional modeling, SQL, SQL, SQL, DBA, Python, R, Pandas, MySQL, PostreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redshift, AWS, RDS, Linux, Ubuntu, bash, DevOps, Sysadmin, Bamboo, Ansible, Fabric, CI.<p>Who&#x27;s Backstage?  We&#x27;re the leading platform in creative talent placement. We are currently composed of two brands: Backstage.com, for actors; and Sonicbids.com, for musicians -- with plans to launch a third vertical by the end of 2016.  At under 70 people, we&#x27;re a small business with the casual energy, collaborative mindset, and get-things-done attitude of a startup, but the stability and mature decision making of a more established company.<p>We offer benefits including health insurance (vision and dental available), commuter benefits, 401K, unlimited vacation, summer Fridays, and tickets&#x2F;tuition for select conferences&#x2F;courses. Our DUMBO office is spacious and convenient to 3 subway lines, and we offer snacks and a couple days per week work-from-home.<p>Apply at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;backstage&#x2F;d5228dde-c2cd-4c43-b8cf-eba64dcf6d7e\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;backstage&#x2F;d5228dde-c2cd-4c43-b8cf-eba6...</a><p>By the way, if this sounds like an awesome place to work, we&#x27;re also hiring an experienced iOS engineer in Brooklyn and a senior front-end engineer in Boston! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;backstage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;backstage</a>",
