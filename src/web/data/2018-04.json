The work environment is friendly &amp; welcoming, with plenty of free food, cool events, and intellectual stimulation.<p>The top requirements are that you&#x27;ve got at least 5 years of relevant programming experience and enough Django&#x2F;JavaScript (preferably Ember) knowledge that you make smart architectural decisions without needing a lot of oversight.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to the job description where you can apply: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.jobvite.com&#x2F;newyork-public-radio&#x2F;job&#x2F;opUa7fwk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.jobvite.com&#x2F;newyork-public-radio&#x2F;job&#x2F;opUa7fwk</a>",

Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.",

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper\u2019s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis\u201d. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important.

We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!",

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.<p>We\u2019re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they\u2019re right.<p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].<p>If you\u2019re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noredink.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;team</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NoRedInk&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;136615783598&#x2F;welcome-evan</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-hiring-process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;145260396603&#x2F;our-engineering-h...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.noredink.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;143787279069&#x2F;on-boarding-as-a-...</a>",

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!",
