Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school\u2019s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students\u2026 which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren\u2019t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that\u2019s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.</p><p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven\u2019t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you\u2019re a five-person startup and you\u2019ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there\u2019s simply no way to get your product in front of students.</p><p>Clever is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools\u2026 which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they\u2019re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we\u2019re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 29,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.</p><p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.

Sunnyvale. \nJob Title: Application Security Consultant</p><p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--</p><p>Once a professor shared a piece of career advice with me.  \"Don't call yourself a coder,\" he said, \"anyone can learn to code, but programming takes real skill.\"  His words have stuck with me since.  Coding was, in his description, the mere act of producing something a computer can interpret and act upon.  Programming, however, seeks elegance and simplicity through considered design and thought that transcends the code itself.  While both take skill, the goals are different and they can be thought of as distinct disciplines.</p><p>Application Security, I've come to believe, is yet another discipline with a slightly different focus.  'Coders' focus almost exclusively on iterating until they achieve a desired result. 'Programmers' might test and refine to improve performance and reduce resource consumption. But with an Application Security perspective, we instead look at unintended functionality and edge cases that give rise to problems; 'What if' scenarios involving abuse cases that weren't part of the original design.  It's yet another way of looking at the same application, with a different goal and different outcome.</p><p>At Matasano, we don't build software, we break it.  We find, exploit, document, and prioritize flaws so the application's developers can address them.  We identify when security controls are effective, and note areas for improvement.  We review use cases, identify abuse cases, and help guide future development efforts. We work across a wide variety of applications ranging from simple web apps, to complex hardware appliances. From HTTP to proprietary encrypted protocols, and everything in between.  As a team, we're as comfortable with ROP chains and memory corruption vulnerabilities as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection.  As individuals, we excel in our areas of focus while cross-training and broadening our skills.  We're among the leaders in our industry and community, and give back through research, tools, and practice environments.</p><p>If improving the state of software security while kicking up some dirt in the process seems like fun, check us out.  If you're fueled by pride of finding unexpected solutions, we have plenty of challenging problems for you. If you're not content to be a 'coder' and long for something more fulfilling, get in touch.</p><p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--</p><p>careers@matasano.com or www.matasano.com for more info</p><p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--</p><p>Curious about Crypto?  - www.cryptopals.com\nMesmerized by Memory Corruption? - www.microcorruption.com</p><p>-- .- - .- ... .- -. ---    ... . -.-. ..- .-. .. - -.--</p></font>",

Typical tasks will include contributing to our core traffic inspection capability to extract information from network traffic generated by apps on mobile devices, analysis of data (including social network analysis), development of user-facing apps for parents (responsive website for now and moving to iOS and Android Apps soon), and support of the product in a production environment (aka DevOps).</p><p>Skills we are interested in:\n* Strong knowledge of networking (low-level IP, HTTP, and VPNs).\n* Strong computer science fundamentals.

As we scale up we will likely add another, higher-performance langue to the backend. Maybe Go, but you can help us make that decision.</p></font>",

In the past year, I've worked with Python, Objective-C\n    (and Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT, Node.js, and\n    of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer.

You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software developer on this awesome team.

We're a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over \u00a3600 million of bets since launching in 2010.

We\u2019re bringing data driven decision making and analytics to an industry that\u2019s been around about as long as human civilization.</p><p>Given the breadth of the system, \"Full Stack\" is probably an understatement so we\u2019re calling it a Full Stack+ until we come up with something better. Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let\u2019s make a crane talk to our servers.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one. This means that there will be a lot of learning on the job and plenty of room for influencing architecture and technology choices.</p><p>About the Environment</p><p>We have one developer (the guy writing this) and one hardware engineer (the CEO) at the moment so you will be joining a very early team. Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.\nWe will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems. Even though are moving fast we will also be building our processes and culture and we\u2019re looking for someone who is excited to help us do that.</p><p>Responsibilities</p><p>Building and expanding our distributed service-oriented/API-driven architecture Coding the wearable tech and base stations Scaling our data collection capabilities Helping build and expand our analytics and event engine Many, many other things\nTechnical Skills/Minimum Requirements\nThe ideal candidate must meet the following minimum requirements:</p><p>You are fluent in Python, Ruby, or another scripting language. Ideally you are a polyglot. We will be making web interfaces so of course JS/HTML/CSS skills are required. You know or are not afraid to get to know C/other low level languages. You have used relational databases, and at least have looked into some non-relational database. Column oriented database experience a plus! You have used MVC frameworks before (Django/Rails/Laravel/etc), and have used at least one Javascript framework. You enjoy writing clean readable code and don't mind getting rid of old code when it's the right thing to do. You haven't used some_random_technology? Great! We'll likely be using a lot of that. This means you don't mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly. Version control is a must. We use Git.</p><p>Important Non-tech Factors</p><p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough. An experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting. Good communications skills and personal accountability are a must. When things go wrong, tell people and fix them. As the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor. Experience working in a startup is a plus.\nTechnical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy/be interesting)</p><p>Working with/messing around with Unity or other gaming/3D engines. Prior experience with Arduino/other hardware prototyping. Experience with hardware/EE. Familiarity with Machine Learning.</p><p>Don't hit all the bullet points? Apply anyways, it would be totally unreasonable to expect someone to have all of the above, we're really more concerned about finding smart devs who think this sounds like a really interesting project. Please include any portfolio site/github/etc. and send info to brian@humanconditionglobal.com</p></font>",

We do this work because we believe deeply in the transformative power that learning can have on people's lives, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down the barriers that prevent many people from reaching their full potential and living empowered lives.</p><p>We started out as a group of students volunteering on the open-source KA Lite project (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>), an offline version of Khan Academy, which we first announced publicly in December of 2012. An enthusiastic global response led to a flood of requests for support, features, and partnerships, and we soon realized we needed to establish a solid foundation to support the project and the longer-term vision, so we incorporated as a nonprofit in April of 2013. We have been fortunate enough to raise some funding to support our continued work, and now have 3 full-time employees, as well as a number of contractors and interns, alongside a community of volunteers and open-source contributors. We are leasing offices in the Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space on the UC San Diego campus, and collaborate closely with researchers and students across the campus.</p><p>We're now looking to grow our core team by hiring someone who will help us to drive our mission and projects forward, playing a strong collaborative and leadership role in both the development process and in the organization as a whole. We have a lot we want to accomplish, and want to continue building a positive, dynamic, and diverse team to help ensure our vision flourishes.</p><p>## Our plans</p><p>KA Lite has now been installed thousands of times in over 130 countries (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/map/</a>), in contexts as varied as low-income schools in India, orphanages in Cameroon, prisons across the United States, refugee programs in Lebanon, and First Nations community centers in northern Canada. We plan to continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user experience, and supporting deployments around the world.</p><p>Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.</p><p>## About you</p><p>* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/values/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/about/values/</a>).</p><p>* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and contractors.</p><p>* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best to serve user needs.</p><p>* You have skills and experience with web development/design, hopefully using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5, Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS/LESS (visual design tools also a plus).</p><p>* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs, etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes), Quality Assurance (automated and/or manual testing).</p><p>## About the job</p><p>* We're looking to fill a full-time position (likely starting with a 3-month trial contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary, 401(k) matching, and health care options. If you feel you might not yet have enough experience for the full-time position, but are excited about what we're doing, contact us anyway, as we have an internship program that could be a way to learn, and get your foot in the door!</p><p>* We offer flexible schedules and vacation time. We emphasize a healthy work-life balance, accomplishing as much as we can while also taking care of ourselves and our families, and having fun!</p><p>* Your exact title in the organization would be determined in collaboration with you, on the basis of the skills you bring to the table, and the focus of the role you'll be playing on the team. See our team page for some examples of current and past titles (<a href=\"https://learningequality.org/about/team/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://learningequality.org/about/team/</a>).</p><p>* You'd be working in sunny San Diego, at our offices on the lively UCSD campus.

Our solution deals with lots of money and game transactions and we integrate with many content providers that our customers can then pick and choose from to offer as their solutions. Our customers all work in highly regulated markets so there are quite a few laws that we must adhere to in our day to day work.</p><p>### How?</p><p>We use a full C#.Net stack and related technologies - IIS, SQL Server and Windows Server. Performance is king so we tend to get fairly low level in the code. We are working in Scrum and you will be working side by side with all kinds of engineers - developers, testers and other ops people. Everyone contributes an individual piece to the bigger puzzle of our development cycle.</p><p>### Why?</p><p>We need experienced DevOps Engineers to join the team and help us building a shippable platform that gives us details on what is happening before it happens. The supporting tools we use are flexible and don't have to run on Windows or C#. If you have always wanted to implement DevOps solutions that will be tested in scale (not Google/Facebook, but rather financial institution) we can offer you an exciting environment to work in.</p><p>### More!</p><p>Architecture as code, dashboards, automatic deployments, performance measurements, working with dev, working with testers. Create from scratch, enhance, improve. If you always wanted to setup a DevOps lifecycle with the building blocks you chose - this could be an opportunity for you.</p><p>We are in northern Madrid and are ideally looking for full time people, if you want to just check out Madrid for a few months we can maybe talk as well but it's not our preferred option. Also - we need presence in the office so unfortunately no remote work :( If you want to practice your Spanish you will get ample opportunity but our official language is English.</p><p>Salaries are competitive within Europe/Spain but are not Silicon Valley level.</p><p>Shoot me an email if you are interested with a rundown of your previous experience - my name is Andre and I am the Technical Director, email me at jobs_hn@mediatechsolutions.es</p></font>",

We're looking for an independent, experienced backend engineer to join our team and and contribute while learning the infrastructure. An ideal candidate would be comfortable with designing and implementing web APIs; building and testing autoscaled services; and being productive, professional, and personable on a daily basis.</p><p>Tone B (nerdy):</p><p>There's a word to describe the freezing of a machine that executes billions of electronic instructions per second, then examining its memory's contents bit, by, bit: debugging. If hitting breakpoints sends chills down your spine, you're probably cut out for backend engineering at Mapsense. Hack away at the backend of a complex but intuitive geodata analysis API, implemented as a distributed, autoscaled nexus of modern open source technologies. And in case joining a team of intelligent, highly motivated code ninjas isn't enough, we have one more guarantee: consider boredom a thing of the past.</p><p>Tone C (cute):</p><p>The one thing that sets Mapsense apart from all the other geodata startups is the sheer popularity of our cute office dog, Amos. To be honest, our backend engineering team is a little jealous of all that attention. They've already developed a versatile but highly intuitive API for geodata ingestion and analysis, all while placing massive emphasis on documentation, testing, and teamwork. But to really shine, they need some help! Will you be the next independent, experienced engineer to join the backend ranks and help surpass Amos' renown once and for all?</p><p>Tone D (challenging):</p><p>Tired of companies living off of boring CRUD APIs with a single, static database? So are we. The backend engineering team at Mapsense is building a distributed, scalable backend architecture to support the ingestion and analysis of massive amounts of geodata, but writing well-designed, documented, and fully tested code isn't easy. That's why we're only hiring highly motivated, independent engineers to join a tiny backend team always willing to commit to quality. It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.</p><p>Tone E (meaningful):</p><p>Help Mapsense revolutionize the process of geodata analysis by joining our backend engineering team in developing an incredibly versatile tool with use cases in a variety of industries, from climate to marketing to military. You'll have the opportunity to jump into a robust, scalable system built on the latest open source backend technologies, and work with a motivated group of engineers. Expect to grow from interesting engineering problems every day while transforming the world one data set at a time.</p></font>",

DocNav is launching a product that solves a unique problem in the legal technology space, but whose applications range well beyond law firms to include hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate firms, investment banks, and beyond. More broadly, the mission of the company is to bring technology to bear on problems that professionals in finance, investment, and law don\u2019t even know they have.</p><p>### The Product</p><p>DocNav makes large, complex legal and financial documents interactive and easy to navigate and untangle. The product is simple to use and intuitive, but results in a very powerful user experience with a learning curve that is almost zero. The idea and design are based on my own 15-year career in the private equity and hedge fund business and the product is something I wanted but could not find.</p><p>The current product is in private beta and getting a strong response from the hedge fund community. It has so far been described as \u2018magic\u2019 and \u2018legendary\u2019 by guys who don\u2019t often use the words \u2018magic\u2019 and \u2018legendary\u2019 for professional services. Applications of the product are far ranging and user segments include hedge funds, private equity funds, asset management firms, investment banks, in-house counsel\u2019s offices, COO\u2019s and CFO\u2019s, and law firms ranging from top 20 \u201cwhite-shoe\u201d firms to small and medium size offices.</p><p>### The Position</p><p>This is a chance to build a unique product with far-ranging applications that could develop in numerous different directions. I want to work with someone who is excited to solve nerdy engineering and design problems, and who will proactively suggest solutions or new directions.</p><p>You will be on a lean team with lots of interesting things to work on, including developing and refining algorithms to make sense of unstructured documents, refining an elegant user experience, hacking growth to increase the user base, and helping turn a beta product into a truly enterprise-grade, scalable, secure application. Experience with or an interest in natural language processing and machine learning methods is a plus, but the most important thing is an ability to creatively solve technical problems.</p><p>No BS environment, let\u2019s create a great product and see where it takes us, there are tons of directions this could go.</p><p>### About Me</p><p>I\u2019m an electrical engineer by schooling but spent my entire career working for hedge funds and private equity firms doing everything from leverage buyouts and growth investments to trading structured credit bonds. I left the business because I was more interested in bringing technology to bear on all kinds of problems that exist at financial firms. I have built the product myself up to this point, but now I want to build a team and need a talented engineer and a teammate to take the product to the next level and push forward with product development, user growth, and revenue generation in the near term.</p><p>### Current Development Stack</p><p>- Python / Django\n- AWS EC2, S3, RDS (Postgres)\n- HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (though we will have outside development help on front end design and implementation, I need a real engineer to figure out deeper solutions for architecting and implementing new killer features)\n- Backbone.js</p><p>### Compensation</p><p>Competitive compensation package consisting of salary plus equity.</p><p>### Contact</p><p>Please send resumes to rishi@docnavlab.com, www.docnavapp.com</p></font>",

What's \"containerization\"? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as \"Lightweight Virtualization\".<p>That's why we recently launched Docker (<a href=\"http://www.docker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.docker.com/</a>) &amp; Docker Hub (<a href=\"http://hub.docker.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hub.docker.com</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily &amp; a community Hub for the community to organize, share and create images publicly as well as privately. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.</p><p>Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href=\"https://github.com/docker/docker\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/docker/docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced?

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
