We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us access\n    to lots of cool machines.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team.

We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>We're a rapidly growing startup (you'd be #18), but well funded ($6M) and have customers at places like Harvard, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.</p><p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.</p><p>Recent coverage:</p><p>- <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcriptic-the-secret-robot-lab-that's-shaking-up-science\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/18/5216738/inside-transcript...</a></p><p>- <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4-1m-in-the-bank-transcriptic-wants-to-reinvent-scientific-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/18/aws-for-life-science-with-4...</a></p><p>team at transcriptic.com</p><p><a href=\"https://www.transcriptic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a></p></font>",

They believe in us.</p><p>We have awesome problems to solve.</p><p>The housing market provides a fantastic blend of problems. We need creative people to help us combine the data about every address in America with the soft side of helping people find a home that makes them feel safe, happy, and comfortable.</p><p>Stability is wonderful.</p><p>We're that rare company that holds the culture of its startup roots, while blending in the sanity of a regular work schedule with an emphasis on work/life/family balance.</p><p>Trulia is a successful rapidly growing Internet technology company, redefining the home search experience for consumers and changing the way real estate professionals build their businesses.

Our goal is to make it possible for any maker or product designer to get their product to market quickly and easily, whether their market is 100 users or 100,000.</p><p>Fully interactive and automatic production tools for electronic products, with direct control over all just-in-time manufacturing and fulfillment tasks through the web and via APIs. MacroFab is the first electronics manufacturing service to give makers and entrepreneurs a completely transparent, scalable, and manageable outsourcing capability.</p><p>===== Why Work with Us?</p><p>We\u2019re creating the next generation of manufacturing services, one which is powered not by cheap labor, but by intelligent software and beautiful machines. We\u2019re creating a service that has all of the capabilities we needed when we had a small products company. We\u2019re makers, developers, and entrepreneurs who are working to enable other makers, developers, and entrepreneurs. We are all about building things: machines, software, and communities. We\u2019re focused on that point where abstracts meet reality and concrete inventions are born. If you like creating new, beautiful code and machines, if you like the challenge of tackling difficult problems, and if you want to help inventors and makers get from idea to product fast while saving them money and time, then we\u2019d love to have you on our team.</p><p>====== About You</p><p>As a Lead Developer at MacroFab, you\u2019ll be responsible for creating stable, performant APIs and control systems to run our network of manufacturing equipment, 3D printers, and warehousing systems.

You\u2019ll build great, reliable APIs in Mojolicious, and solve complex task management in Python, C++, Erlang, or whatever language you believe will be able to solve the problem most effectively.  Of course, to fit in with our existing tech stack, you\u2019ll have working knowledge of (Or, will be able to pick it up fast!) RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, memcached, MySQL, and AWS APIs.</p><p>You\u2019re the kind of person that thinks crafting 4-dimensional bin packing algorithms is fun, but also believes in shipping software every day.  You can get into the seat of your users and understand the pains they feel and absolutely must solve those problems with your work.  You always build software using best industry practices and have kept your knowledge of security and performance concerns up-to-date.  As a Lead Developer, you\u2019ll pride yourself in the examples you set for your team. You\u2019ll be part of a small team, and will have the autonomy you need to express your creativity in all of the ways you want.</p><p>======= Get in Touch!</p><p>Send your resume and some examples of your work to jobs@macrofab.net</p></font>",

If you're a smart, motivated developer who likes our company culture, let's talk.</p><p>Over the past 16 years we've cultivated a great group of people to work with. Our developers are smart, thoughtful, respectful to each other, opinionated, dedicated, and fun. We don't hire often, and when we do, we value these qualities as much as technical abilities.</p><p>Founded by a former computer science professor, in many ways we keep the same feel as a small computer science lab (without the long hours):</p><p></p><pre><code>    Challenging and varied projects\n    Informal, comfortable environment\n    Intelligent, engaged people\n    Lively, respectful technology discussions\n    Frequent mentoring\n    Easy camaraderie\n    General culture of helpfulness and friendliness \n</code></pre>\nTeams at TechEmpower are typically between 2 and 6 people. Because of the small size of our teams, we need developers able to work on all aspects of an application (\"full stack\" developers). We rely on individual developers to do much of the software design, with guidance and discussion, and actively work to improve each other's technical capabilities.<p>On average, a typical developer will get exposure to 3 or 4 different projects over the course of a year. Since each project has a different technology stack, developers gain varied experience over time and never stop learning.</p><p>We pride ourselves on doing the best work we can for our clients. This means working with them to really understand what they need built, carefully planning how to do it, and delivering what we promise while maintaining a sensible work/life balance. We build quality applications and have fun doing it.</p><p>Also, we enjoy programming on high-performance workstations with 4K displays. A lot of code fits in 3840x2160 pixels!</p><p>The technologies we use vary over time with our mix of projects. Here is a snapshot of the technologies we use at the moment:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) \n</code></pre>\nWe don't expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but developers at TechEmpower can expect to expand their skillsets with most of these over time.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to work, please apply here: \n<a href=\"http://jobs.techempower.com/hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn</a></p></font>",

We have developed a computational platform that can predict how a potential drug will behave in the lab and the body. We use this platform to process large spaces of chemistry while searching for therapies for some of the world\u2019s most important diseases, such as, obesity, heart failure, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s disease. Our platform makes the drug development process cheaper, faster, and results in higher success rates than traditional approaches.</p><p>--- Our Stack ---</p><p>Our stack consists of a proprietary distributed computational platform, Numatix, which in-turn consists of cloud management, job management, job execution engine and custom dataflow language layers. We generally run this on top of Amazon Web Services, where we often scale the system to more than 10,000 cores. We are working to scale it to over 100,000 cores. On top of Numatix we run a number of custom libraries and services, such as machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, mathematics, etc. At the very top of our stack sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, NIX command line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Couchbase, custom built). The code base is written in Java, Scala, Python, and some C++. All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.</p><p>Join us, and code for more than just clicks!</p><p>For more information see <a href=\"https://github.com/Numerate/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Numerate/hiring</a> or shoot us an email to eng_job@numerate.com</p></font>",

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.</p><p>We have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:</p><p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts' dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.</p><p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.</p><p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a-one-man-fantasy-sports-app-maker/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps. We have a great team of designers and developers, and Yahoo mobile is actually now the largest mobile development organization in the world! We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.</p><p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!</p><p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don't have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!</p><p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!</p></font>",

We\u2019re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.</p><p>WHO WE ARE.  Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation\u2019s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).</p><p>WHAT WE USE.  We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We\u2019ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we\u2019re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don\u2019t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.</p><p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE.  We\u2019re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important \u2014 and usually the hardest \u2014 thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.</p><p>WHERE WE\u2019RE AT.  Geographically we\u2019re currently at Nuffield Health's offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices) but a move to Brighton is likely in the works over the next year. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you\u2019d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.</p><p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk</p></font>",

However, continued use of the space environment over the last 60 years has polluted the orbits around the Earth with debris. Currently only a small fraction of space debris is tracked. Failure to capture this data more accurately, and model its behaviour, could result in us losing access to space entirely if a space debris cascade event is allowed to occur.</p><p>The aim of this PhD project is to describe the current space debris environment using cutting edge astrodynamics methods and model its evolution over time using machine learning techniques and spatio-temporal data analysis. The Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL) has become a world leader in accurately modelling the many forces acting on spacecraft in orbit. Our models are currently employed by both NASA and ESA to supply data to support scientific environmental monitoring missions (JASON-1, SENTINEL). SpaceTimeLab have a wealth of experience in the analysis, modelling, simulation and visualisation of large spatio-temporal datasets, with applications in transportation, crime and disaster response. This is an exciting opportunity to build on these models and develop novel techniques to gain new insights into the behaviour of the space debris environment.</p><p>Skills you will learn include design, development and testing of algorithms, software and database development, experimental design and implementation, data analysis and both technical and interpersonal communication. You will also have the opportunity to build a network of contacts within both the astrodynamics and spatio-temporal data analysis communities.</p><p>This project is a collaboration between UCL\u2019s Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory and SpaceTimeLab and will be supervised by Dr Stuart Grey and Dr James Haworth.</p><p>Eligibility: Applications are invited from UK and EU members, residing in UK.</p><p>Application Procedure: Applicants should send a covering letter and CV to s.grey@ucl.ac.uk</p><p>Start Date: The post will be available from September 2014</p><p>Duration: 4 Years</p><p>Funding: The scholarship covers UCL registration fees and provides a stipend of \u00a315,726 per annum tax free. Travel expenses and research equipment will also be paid for.</p><p>Funding Body:EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)</p></font>",
