If you're a smart, motivated developer who likes our company culture, let's talk.</p><p>Over the past 16 years we've cultivated a great group of people to work with. Our developers are smart, thoughtful, respectful to each other, opinionated, dedicated, and fun. We don't hire often, and when we do, we value these qualities as much as technical abilities.</p><p>Founded by a former computer science professor, in many ways we keep the same feel as a small computer science lab (without the long hours):</p><p></p><pre><code>    Challenging and varied projects\n    Informal, comfortable environment\n    Intelligent, engaged people\n    Lively, respectful technology discussions\n    Frequent mentoring\n    Easy camaraderie\n    General culture of helpfulness and friendliness \n</code></pre>\nTeams at TechEmpower are typically between 2 and 6 people. Because of the small size of our teams, we need developers able to work on all aspects of an application (\"full stack\" developers). We rely on individual developers to do much of the software design, with guidance and discussion, and actively work to improve each other's technical capabilities.<p>On average, a typical developer will get exposure to 3 or 4 different projects over the course of a year. Since each project has a different technology stack, developers gain varied experience over time and never stop learning.</p><p>We pride ourselves on doing the best work we can for our clients. This means working with them to really understand what they need built, carefully planning how to do it, and delivering what we promise while maintaining a sensible work/life balance. We build quality applications and have fun doing it.</p><p>Also, we enjoy programming on high-performance workstations with 4K displays. A lot of code fits in 3840x2160 pixels!</p><p>The technologies we use vary over time with our mix of projects. Here is a snapshot of the technologies we use at the moment:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) \n</code></pre>\nWe don't expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but developers at TechEmpower can expect to expand their skillsets with most of these over time.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to work, please apply here: \n<a href=\"http://jobs.techempower.com/hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn</a></p></font>",

We're already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here's what's awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we're making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there's one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We're rapidly adding new features, and we're quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it\u2019s time to hire a UX/UI designer.</p><p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they\u2019re flying through their day.</p><p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it\u2019s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.</p><p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we\u2019ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, \u2018make this button blue\u2019 or it could be more elaborate like, \u2018add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,\u2019 or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they\u2019ve noticed small, nice design improvements.</p><p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they\u2019re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.</p><p>List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we\u2019re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.</p><p>We\u2019re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We\u2019re small (3 in-office employees) and we\u2019re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we\u2019re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.</p><p>Send an email to fintechw14@gmail.com telling us about yourself. Include a resume and a portfolio if possible.</p></font>",

However, continued use of the space environment over the last 60 years has polluted the orbits around the Earth with debris. Currently only a small fraction of space debris is tracked. Failure to capture this data more accurately, and model its behaviour, could result in us losing access to space entirely if a space debris cascade event is allowed to occur.</p><p>The aim of this PhD project is to describe the current space debris environment using cutting edge astrodynamics methods and model its evolution over time using machine learning techniques and spatio-temporal data analysis. The Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL) has become a world leader in accurately modelling the many forces acting on spacecraft in orbit. Our models are currently employed by both NASA and ESA to supply data to support scientific environmental monitoring missions (JASON-1, SENTINEL). SpaceTimeLab have a wealth of experience in the analysis, modelling, simulation and visualisation of large spatio-temporal datasets, with applications in transportation, crime and disaster response. This is an exciting opportunity to build on these models and develop novel techniques to gain new insights into the behaviour of the space debris environment.</p><p>Skills you will learn include design, development and testing of algorithms, software and database development, experimental design and implementation, data analysis and both technical and interpersonal communication. You will also have the opportunity to build a network of contacts within both the astrodynamics and spatio-temporal data analysis communities.</p><p>This project is a collaboration between UCL\u2019s Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory and SpaceTimeLab and will be supervised by Dr Stuart Grey and Dr James Haworth.</p><p>Eligibility: Applications are invited from UK and EU members, residing in UK.</p><p>Application Procedure: Applicants should send a covering letter and CV to s.grey@ucl.ac.uk</p><p>Start Date: The post will be available from September 2014</p><p>Duration: 4 Years</p><p>Funding: The scholarship covers UCL registration fees and provides a stipend of \u00a315,726 per annum tax free. Travel expenses and research equipment will also be paid for.</p><p>Funding Body:EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)</p></font>",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us access\n    to lots of cool machines.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15.

You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team.

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.</p><p>We have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:</p><p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts' dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.</p><p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.</p><p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a-one-man-fantasy-sports-app-maker/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps. We have a great team of designers and developers, and Yahoo mobile is actually now the largest mobile development organization in the world! We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.</p><p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!</p><p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don't have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!</p><p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!</p></font>",

We\u2019re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.</p><p>WHO WE ARE.  Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation\u2019s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=\"http://mappiness.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).</p><p>WHAT WE USE.  We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We\u2019ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we\u2019re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don\u2019t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.</p><p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE.  We\u2019re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important \u2014 and usually the hardest \u2014 thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.</p><p>WHERE WE\u2019RE AT.  Geographically we\u2019re currently at Nuffield Health's offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices) but a move to Brighton is likely in the works over the next year. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you\u2019d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.</p><p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk</p></font>",

Sometimes we write cool new code, sometimes we are on call dealing with a production issue.</p><p>* We think pushing code into production is only the beginning of our job.
