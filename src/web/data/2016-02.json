Junior, senior, doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that you&#x27;re smart, knowledgeable about CS, and incredibly passionate about games. Message me via jmazer@riotgames.com if you want to chat.<p>I search for people who are passionate about games. Not the kinds that just dabble, and who sometimes reminisce about that time that they played Mario back in the day. I look for the kinds that can literally count their play time in years rather than days. Notice - I&#x27;m not talking about League... That&#x27;s because R&amp;D is focused on making Riot&#x27;s NEXT game. We&#x27;re looking at several different spaces and we need talent with as varied a palette of interests as our development interests.<p>I&#x27;m not only looking for industry veterans. If you come from a Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc., and want to keep your standard of living, work on games, and also keep a high level of stability, Riot is a great place to consider making an industry change.<p>Reasons you might want to chat:<p>1.) Riot believes in delivering genre-defining content that delights players. The R&amp;D group&#x27;s charter is to flesh out and eventually ship the game(s) that put the &#x27;s&#x27; in Riot Games. If you want to build new stuff this is the place to be.<p>2.) We\u2019ve only got a few R&amp;D projects going at a time, with a handful of people on each team. Joining the team now means playing a seminal role in developing and leading the downstream organization.<p>3.) Riot landed as #13 on Fortune&#x27;s top 100 companies to work for.<p>4.) We\u2019re exploring some familiar genres and some experimental ones, but all of them are genres we expect core gamers love. It&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll be excited by at least one of our current projects.",

Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we use pull requests &amp; code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:\n  - high performance distributed systems\n  - robust &amp; well-factored codebases\n  - simple &amp; fast deployments\n  - automating the hell out of operations\n  - thorough system test coverage\n  - managing our own development process and work backlog\n  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)\n  - contributing back to the clojure &amp; open source community\nWhat we do:\n  - write all our production systems &amp; tools in Clojure\n  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems\n  - spin up web services for consuming &amp; ingesting large volumes of data<p>For a glimpse behind the scenes, check out a talk we gave at Clojure&#x2F;West last year. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=av9Xi6CNqq4</a>.<p>Does this sound like something you&#x27;re into?

Also, he likes Signal a lot.<p>If you really believe that we&#x27;re entering a pitched battle between states and technology providers over encryption; that NSA and GCHQ are turning the world&#x27;s best-funded best-staffed signals intelligence agencies into instruments of domestic surveillance; that giant corporations (and aspiring giant corporations) are doing everything they can to ensure that users <i>think</i> they&#x27;re safe while their messages are scanned for ad targeting or censored and traced by despotic regimes; if these are real concerns for you, then this is one of the most important jobs on the Internet.<p>Until very recently, the iOS version of Signal was managed by Frederic Jacobs. Signal for iOS is a flagship Whisper offering. It should by rights be the most widely used tool for journalists, activists, and researchers to communicate confidently on an insecure Internet. Jacobs is amazing, but he&#x27;s off to other adventures in Switzerland, and Whisper needs someone to take the reins on iOS Signal.<p>This is not the most highly-paid role on the Hiring Thread, but it&#x27;s probably the one that stands to make the biggest dent in the universe. Why else would you consider joining Moxie and his crazy pirate crew of crypto developers?<p>* Because you&#x27;re not a cryptographer but want to be engaged with serious cryptography, of the kind that will be in the academic cite record a decade from now, in a role where you&#x27;ll make an enormous difference deciding how best to get strong crypto into the hands of everyday people.<p>* Because Moxie and his team are simply excellent people to work with, doing inspiring stuff that is <i>actually inspiring</i>, not cat-sharing.<p>* Because there are worse things to have on your resume than &quot;product lead for the most important product by a tiny team that took on multi-billion dollar world government spy agencies and won&quot;.<p>* Because you relish the opportunity to be on an HN NSA thread with &#x27;tptacek and be able, at any point, to say &quot;shut up, Thomas, I work for Whisper&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t work for Whisper, Whisper will never pay me a dime. I just love what they do, know that they&#x27;re trying very hard to find this particular person, and want to do whatever I can to help (and to ensure I&#x27;ll be able to keep using Signal).<p>Full time role. Very strong iOS application skills needed. No cryptography experience needed at all (if you take this job, you&#x27;re going to have crypto coming out of your ears either way). <i>The right candidate does not need to be in San Francisco</i>.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whispersystems.org&#x2F;workworkwork&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whispersystems.org&#x2F;workworkwork&#x2F;</a><p>If you know iOS developers who are interested in the problem Whisper is working on, please let them know about this.<p>Thanks!",

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic&#x27;s central, highly automated &#x27;biocenter&#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>Our bioengineers apply math to hard biological problems, ranging from liquid handling optimization to reasoning about how &quot;identical&quot; reagents diverge over time to interfere with reproducibility. You&#x27;ll have an opportunity to do original research with internal capacity, too.<p>We&#x27;re a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.<p>All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time.

We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Berlin and Sydney. More offices are coming soon. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably. Right now we are particularly trying to grow in Labs and Cloud Foundry.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on. Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

        "full_html": "San Francisco, CA- Programmers, Infrastructure, Sales<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines.<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.\nAnd there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>).

Almost 70% of russia&#x27;s exports are petrol products: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;all&#x2F;show&#x2F;2014&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;all...</a><p>And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;show&#x2F;2709&#x2F;2014&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;sho...</a><p>The big blue chunk is europe, meaning a sanction would really hurt Russia. However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;show&#x2F;all&#x2F;2709&#x2F;2014&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;sho...</a><p>There\u2019s practically no one who\u2019s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It\u2019s interesting how it\u2019s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that\u2019s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front.\nIt\u2019s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;show&#x2F;all&#x2F;2709&#x2F;2014&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;show&#x2F;all...</a><p>Which probably explains why EU hasn&#x27;t placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.<p>Think you could design&#x2F;build&#x2F;use this better?
