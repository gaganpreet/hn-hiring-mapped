Different firms, different challenges. Here, a chance to grapple with large-scale payments; there, a purpose-built \"big data\" storage system; elsewhere, software running on an exotic platform; look hard enough and you may even find custom hardware to tinker with.</p><p>Consider a greater challenge: the one lurking in the shadows beneath all the other challenges; a maddening, beautiful challenge that awaits all applications, be they YC startups or giant tech companies, the hunt for which leads through the crevices of the payment processing gateways, the arcane backend of the storage system, and the insane, non-euclidian instruction patterns output by embedded compilers. The discovery of the unknown horrible secrets of our universe, the bending of those secrets to your will, and the billing of clients for PDF documentation of those secrets along with their exploitation steps and mitigation advice.</p><p>Matasano and iSEC together comprise one of the largest pure software security firms in the world. Our clients are the best companies --- and <i>most</i> of the largest of them. Our teams include some of the best researchers in the field.</p><p>I hire for both firms, our practices interlocked in an unholy embrace.

Academy \u2014 Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)<p>We're a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.</p><p>Here's a testimonial we received this week:</p><p>==================================</p><p>Two year ago, I would never have imagined that any 13-year-old could be in Calculus BC. Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don't seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don't know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.</p><p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>And now we're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We're totally overhauling our iOS app and we now need a great mobile designer. (We've got some good leads for good devs already, but if you're a dev please do apply too.)</p><p>We need a great mobile designer, one who lives and breathes mobile and really understands what works and what doesn't. If you join us now, you can be a major influence on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.</p><p>You'll be part of a small team working alongside both \"celebrity\" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.</p><p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN. Feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org if you have questions about applying or about KA in general.

As a software developer, you would responsible for end-to-end product development, from architecture, to development, to rollout. You must be comfortable participating in design and code reviews, as well as delivering accurate estimates, providing regular development progress feedback and consistently meeting project deadlines. Our developers are effective at explaining complex ideas and concepts to non-technical team members.</p><p>This is a full time position that would work out of our downtown Detroit office. Occasional telecommuting (like one day a week) is on the table, but we really need people who can be in the office most of the time.</p><p>Here's our stats:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Company size: 19\n\n    Current dev team size: 5 (and hiring as fast as we can find good people)\n\n    Stack: LAMP\n\n    Version Control: Git\n\n    Bug Tracking: Github Issues\n\n    Project Management: Basecamp\n\n    Mac or PC: Dealer's choice. We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.\n\n    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.\n\n    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.\n\n    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.\n</code></pre>\nA word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We're in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he's partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We're on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we're in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I'm saying is: give it a look.<p>If you're interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.</p></font>",

We specialize in web application development but look for well-rounded application developers. If you are a solid programmer and a team player, this is an opportunity for you. Even if you don't have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets.\nJob Responsibilities</p><p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time.\nJob Qualifications</p><p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients' requirements by asking good questions, for example.</p><p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.</p><p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.</p><p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) \n</code></pre>\nWe like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we're mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with.

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:</p><p>1st class engineer\u00a0</p><p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo\u2019d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they\u2019re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You\u2019ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura &amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You\u2019ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs &amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You\u2019ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality</p><p>Data hungry\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You\u2019ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You\u2019ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you\u2019ve helped architect.</p><p>Open all hours\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you\u2019ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you\u2019ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.</p><p>Solver of riddles\u00a0</p><p>You won\u2019t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you\u2019ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn\u2019t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.</p><p>Getting shit done\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren\u2019t perfect, but you\u2019ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You\u2019ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.</p><p>Commercially aware\u00a0</p><p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You\u2019ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn\u2019t fall over as its user base scales. You\u2019ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.</p><p>Keen eye, tuned ear\u00a0</p><p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We\u2019ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You\u2019ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You\u2019ll know that most project budgets don\u2019t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you\u2019re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.</p><p>Security and speed\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You\u2019ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we\u2019re after. But then you already know that.</p><p>About We Are Base</p><p>We're a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.</p><p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable.\u00a0Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.</p><p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We\u2019re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.</p><p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.</p><p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.</p><p><a href=\"http://wearebase.com/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wearebase.com/hiring</a></p></font>",

And I mean <i>real</i> search scientist, not just someone who put together Solr that one time.<p>We have a client who has a fantastic position which has opened up. They\u2019re searching for you because you\u2019ll be searching for them: they need an expert search engine/data mining specialist and very few people can fill this role.</p><p>You\u2019ll have several years of experience with search engines and (preferably) e-commerce, a proven capability to mine data and a Master\u2019s or Doctorate in Statistics, Math, AI, Computer Science or a comparable background. This isn\u2019t for someone who\u2019s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It\u2019s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won\u2019t be waiting for tasks to do: you\u2019ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.</p><p>How do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it\u2019s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge? How do you do that in a performant manner? Or maybe searches in different languages should be treated differently based on cultural preferences? And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn\u2019t impact sales and you have a better solution?</p><p>The possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company. They\u2019re offering a generous salary, an awesome work/life balance, a generous vacation package and a catch: you have to let them pay to relocate your household (even rats, if you want to) to the heart of Amsterdam, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If you\u2019re going to be sitting down sketching out how to group customers using adaptive resonance theory, wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to do that while sipping a Grolsh, eating bitterballen, next to a beautiful Dutch canal?</p><p>And with 26 days of vacation and 9 public holidays, you\u2019ll have seven weeks off a year to enjoy. Take a relaxing two-week road trip across Europe and return to work with several weeks of holiday left.</p><p>Given the extremely high level of expertise needed for this role, our client realizes that the few people who are both capable and willing to accept this role will need a relocation package. And if you have a family, our client will take care of them, too. Have special relocation requirements? As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you\u2019ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you\u2019ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary. The other 30% will be handed to you tax-free, effectively giving you a huge pay rise on top of an already generous salary.</p><p>This is a high level position in the company and you\u2019ll be given a lot of autonomy to make things happen. Further, the success criteria for the job are extremely clear and you\u2019ll be given all the tools you need to directly measure your success. The exact nature of the role can potentially be tailored to meet your personal preferences.</p><p>The work environment is laid-back, English is the working language, and you\u2019ll be working with other expats with a sense of adventure. Amsterdam is a friendly, low-crime city and almost everyone speaks English fluently, but if you want Dutch lessons, our client will help. Heck, if you have other requirements, bring them and get them on the table. For the right candidate, everything\u2019s open to discussion.</p><p>If this sounds interesting and you want more information, contact us at jobs@allaroundtheworld.fr.</p></font>",

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.</p><p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown\u2026</p><p>Peer Review</p><p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.</p><p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.</p><p>Interface Design</p><p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.</p><p>Recommendation Engine</p><p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.</p><p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper\u2019s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.</p><p>Mobile App</p><p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!</p><p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia\u2019s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia\u2019s data, content and identity into their apps.</p><p>Speed, Scale, &amp; Storage</p><p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.</p><p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.</p><p>Future at Academia.edu</p><p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We're based in Downtown San Francisco.</p><p>Chat with Ashley</p><p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.</p></font>",

What's \"containerization\"? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as \"Lightweight Virtualization\".</p><p>That's why we launched Docker (<a href=\"http://www.docker.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.docker.io/</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.</p><p>Convinced?

As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.</p><p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown\u2026</p><p>Peer Review</p><p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.</p><p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.</p><p>Interface Design</p><p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.</p><p>Recommendation Engine</p><p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.</p><p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper\u2019s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.</p><p>Mobile App</p><p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!</p><p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia\u2019s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia\u2019s data, content and identity into their apps.</p><p>Speed, Scale, &amp; Storage</p><p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.</p><p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.</p><p>Future at Academia.edu</p><p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We're based in Downtown San Francisco.</p><p>Chat with Ashley</p><p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.</p></font>",

You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\nHere\u2019s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</p><p>We are also looking for designers, visual and/or interaction.</p></font>",

I came back to Twin after a year hiatus because this is really as good as it gets. The leadership is fantastic, and work-life balance is deeply ingrained in the culture. On top of that, I can honestly say that I enjoy working with my entire team and look forward to our three yearly get-togethers.</p><p>We're very selective with who we hire, but if you're reading this then it's a good start that you're on Hacker News. For the record I'm not a recruiter or HR for Twin - I'm a tech lead. We've got some big projects in the pipeline and need to find the right people to join us ASAP. Drop me a line if you're interested. Also drop me a line is you have any general questions about tech consulting. Write to andy.tiffany@twintechs.com and please include \"HN\" in the subject.</p></font>",

        "full_html": "<font color=\"#5a5a5a\">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
