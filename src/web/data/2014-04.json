March just came to a close and Buffer stands at 1.4M total users served by a small 21 person team spread across 14 cities and 5 continents. 130,000 of our users are actively using the product each month. We generated $350,000 in March, and we have $580,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I'm sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I'd love for you to be part of the incredible journey we've embarked upon.</p><p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we're seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we'd love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.\nDo any of these areas stand out for you? I'd really love to hear from you:</p><p></p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we're sending 450,000 posts to\n      social networks every day, our architecture is still\n      not ideal)\n    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million\n      downloads but currently no full-time developer!)\n    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are\n      all crying out for an iPad app)\n    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%,\n      we'd love your help improving it and many other\n      metrics)\n    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used\n      Buffer, we'd love to improve our dashboard interface\n      and extensions for them)\n</code></pre>\nSome of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p></p><pre><code>    - We're completely open about salary and equity, in\n      fact here is a spreadsheet of all individual salaries:\n      https://docs.google.com/a/bufferapp.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=1.\n      It's most likely you'd fall into a range of\n      $85,000-$150,000 and 0.1%-1%.\n    - We're a fully distributed remote team, and we come\n      together 3 times a year for super fun retreats.\n      The last one was in Thailand in December, our next\n      is Cape Town in April!\n    - We have a big focus on culture, that's the main thing\n      we think about when someone joins the team. Here is\n      our slide deck of values:\n      http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-03 \n</code></pre>\nI'll read through emails with our CTO Sunil, I hope yours might be part of that.

Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don't seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don't know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.</p><p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>And now we're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We're totally overhauling our iOS app and we now need a great mobile designer. (We've got some good leads for good devs already, but if you're a dev please do apply too.)</p><p>We need a great mobile designer, one who lives and breathes mobile and really understands what works and what doesn't. If you join us now, you can be a major influence on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.</p><p>You'll be part of a small team working alongside both \"celebrity\" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.</p><p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN.

As a software developer, you would responsible for end-to-end product development, from architecture, to development, to rollout. You must be comfortable participating in design and code reviews, as well as delivering accurate estimates, providing regular development progress feedback and consistently meeting project deadlines. Our developers are effective at explaining complex ideas and concepts to non-technical team members.</p><p>This is a full time position that would work out of our downtown Detroit office. Occasional telecommuting (like one day a week) is on the table, but we really need people who can be in the office most of the time.</p><p>Here's our stats:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Company size: 19\n\n    Current dev team size: 5 (and hiring as fast as we can find good people)\n\n    Stack: LAMP\n\n    Version Control: Git\n\n    Bug Tracking: Github Issues\n\n    Project Management: Basecamp\n\n    Mac or PC: Dealer's choice. We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.\n\n    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.\n\n    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.\n\n    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.\n</code></pre>\nA word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We're in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he's partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We're on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we're in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I'm saying is: give it a look.<p>If you're interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.</p></font>",

Even if you don't have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets.\nJob Responsibilities</p><p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time.\nJob Qualifications</p><p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients' requirements by asking good questions, for example.</p><p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.</p><p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.</p><p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:</p><p></p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) \n</code></pre>\nWe like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we're mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with.

And I mean <i>real</i> search scientist, not just someone who put together Solr that one time.<p>We have a client who has a fantastic position which has opened up. They\u2019re searching for you because you\u2019ll be searching for them: they need an expert search engine/data mining specialist and very few people can fill this role.</p><p>You\u2019ll have several years of experience with search engines and (preferably) e-commerce, a proven capability to mine data and a Master\u2019s or Doctorate in Statistics, Math, AI, Computer Science or a comparable background. This isn\u2019t for someone who\u2019s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It\u2019s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won\u2019t be waiting for tasks to do: you\u2019ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.</p><p>How do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it\u2019s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge? How do you do that in a performant manner? Or maybe searches in different languages should be treated differently based on cultural preferences? And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn\u2019t impact sales and you have a better solution?</p><p>The possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company. They\u2019re offering a generous salary, an awesome work/life balance, a generous vacation package and a catch: you have to let them pay to relocate your household (even rats, if you want to) to the heart of Amsterdam, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If you\u2019re going to be sitting down sketching out how to group customers using adaptive resonance theory, wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to do that while sipping a Grolsh, eating bitterballen, next to a beautiful Dutch canal?</p><p>And with 26 days of vacation and 9 public holidays, you\u2019ll have seven weeks off a year to enjoy. Take a relaxing two-week road trip across Europe and return to work with several weeks of holiday left.</p><p>Given the extremely high level of expertise needed for this role, our client realizes that the few people who are both capable and willing to accept this role will need a relocation package. And if you have a family, our client will take care of them, too. Have special relocation requirements? As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you\u2019ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you\u2019ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary. The other 30% will be handed to you tax-free, effectively giving you a huge pay rise on top of an already generous salary.</p><p>This is a high level position in the company and you\u2019ll be given a lot of autonomy to make things happen. Further, the success criteria for the job are extremely clear and you\u2019ll be given all the tools you need to directly measure your success. The exact nature of the role can potentially be tailored to meet your personal preferences.</p><p>The work environment is laid-back, English is the working language, and you\u2019ll be working with other expats with a sense of adventure. Amsterdam is a friendly, low-crime city and almost everyone speaks English fluently, but if you want Dutch lessons, our client will help. Heck, if you have other requirements, bring them and get them on the table. For the right candidate, everything\u2019s open to discussion.</p><p>If this sounds interesting and you want more information, contact us at jobs@allaroundtheworld.fr.</p></font>",

We're currently looking for full-time software developers and designers.</p><p>A little bit about us:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.\n\n  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don't artificially limit ourselves.\n    Recently, I've worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),\n    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.\n\n  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool tools and machines.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
