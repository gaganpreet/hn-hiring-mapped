We have billions of entities, hundreds of billions of facts, an amazing presentation layer, and a growing distribution network of top tier publishers. Everyone needs knowledge (we have well over 100M citations a month), and we\u2019re here to satisfy that need.</p><p>What\u2019s next: we\u2019ve built an amazing product architecture that leverages our expansive knowledge graph.

Unsolicited outreach is strongly encouraged!</p><p>About the team: The challenge of scaling human organizations is not unlike the task of scaling a technology stack. Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can't be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo's 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.findthebest.com/careers/explore-opportunities\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.findthebest.com/careers/explore-opportunities</a></p></font>\n              ",

We find that customer support via Klets makes complete strangers have fun and crack jokes with you, so it's certainly a fun job. We'd also love for you to contribute to our marketing strategy if that's up your alley - content marketing, growth hacks - anything you can think of, really.</p><p>We'd like you to live relatively nearby but we're open to a big part of your work to take place remotely if necessary. So if you're in (or near) the Netherlands but not near Eindhoven, no biggie, with a combination of trains and remote work we'll make things work just fine.</p><p>We're a very young startup, and in our stage, there is no real difference between sales and customer support, and even marketing (because a great product with great support tends to market itself to some extent). If you're looking for a place to really significantly contribute to a startup's growth, get in touch.</p><p>Interested?

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.</p><p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three years, we\u2019re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:</p><p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and</p><p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.</p><p>We\u2019re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We\u2019re looking for full-stack engineers who like:</p><p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)</p><p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)</p><p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)</p><p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets</p><p>Check us out at <a href=\"https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer</a>, or check out what we\u2019re working on at <a href=\"https://github.com/clever\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/clever</a>.</p></font>\n              ",

We have some intense ping pong, corn hole, and Smash Brothers matches. But above all that, we have passion. It's exuded by the amazing and talented people who work here. This isn't your typical punch in punch out job; our employees come in early and stay late. It's because of that dedication we cater dinners and make an effort to stop and eat with one another. This is a 'douche-bag free' zone. We respect all ideas and all people who come through our front doors who are here to learn, contribute, and inspire. The pedigree of our leadership is amazing; founded, IPO'd and sold a company. They believe in the employees that work here and give them every opportunity and tool needed to be successful in this venture.</p><p>WORK \u2013 We're still in stealth, so I can't say much.

Our offices are relaxed, kitchen is well-stocked, and we have fluffy dogs on site.</p><p>* Network Admin/DevOps - We are looking for relentless problem-solvers to join our DevOps team. You will help us predict the future, figure out when we need new stuff before we need it. Attention to uptimes and familiarity with monitoring concepts. You will talk to the team, and you\u2019ll work closely with others within the company to bring projects from planning to launch.</p><p>* Front-end Developer - Someone focused on delivering products with a great UX. Experience building fat JS MVC apps, designing complex stateful apps in a maintainable way, with data visualization using D3 or Processing.

It turns out there\u2019s a lot more to fix. And it\u2019s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, and the willingness to work closely with dedicated civil servants in government.</p><p>Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, it\u2019s about $70M less per year to operate. We\u2019re just getting started, and we\u2019ve started Nava to help fix everything else. [0]</p><p>People die because the Veteran's Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures [1].</p><p>That\u2019s not because there\u2019s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.</p><p>Our team is 10 people (Stanford, Google, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.</p><p>We\u2019re looking for:\n- experienced full-stack engineers\n- experienced devops engineers\n- a product manager with a technical background\n- a hyper-resourceful operations person</p><p>We have a social mission (we just incorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC) this week), but we pay market compensation (above market, for DC) and equity (above market).</p><p>If you'd like to build software and infrastructure that radically improves how our government serves people, we\u2019d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com.</p><p>*Not in DC / able to relocate, but intrigued and in SF?

I just joined as Principal Engineer and I'm loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms &amp; machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women's Fashion e-commerce / subscription service.\nIn english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag \"#stitchfix\" and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month's \"Fix'. Our customer referral-to-friend statistic is off the charts.\nWe're hiring for these roles: Senior Full Stack Rails Engineer, Head of DevOps, Lead iOS Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientists, Product Designer, UX Designer\nOn the business side, it's a startup but we're profitable and we're not planning on seeking additional funding! Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success.\nOn the Engineering side, we're solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I'm responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. I'm only 2 weeks in and I already think this is how all companies should operate (sorry PM's!)\nThere is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics), they are also hiring like crazy. They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer-sat (Tim Cook's favorite quotes stat, which stands for Customer Satisfaction)\nAnyway...don't let the industry put you off, the smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least consider it :)\nCheck out our engineering and algorithms web site: <a href=\"http://technology.stitchfix.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://technology.stitchfix.com/</a> and here is our jobs page <a href=\"https://www.stitchfix.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.stitchfix.com/careers</a>.\nEmail me at gsteinitz (at) stitchfix (dot) com and I can answer any questions for you, or connect you with the hiring manager depending on which job you're interested in.\nGal</font>\n              ",

Our elegant, real-time dashboards solve a valuable, difficult problem for thousands of paying subscribers, by taking the complexity out of connecting to their data and making that data simple for anyone to interpret at a glance. As a result, our customers unlock data they didn't know they had, connect people and join up projects, and make better decisions faster.</p><p>We have a lot of exciting work ahead and are looking for curious and creative problem solvers to help develop our product and take it to even more customers. You'll be joining a friendly team with great people in an environment with empowered developers, flexible working conditions, and a focus on skill development.</p><p>We are looking for full-time senior engineers, both front- and back-end. A variety of skills for modern, scalable web applications - e.g. Chef, React, Go, Ruby, Javascript - are of interest, but we like to have people learn on the job so don't worry about any you might be missing.

We also run fortnightly \"innovation days\", where everyone has complete freedom to work on anything that interests them, from contributing to open-source projects, learning a new skill, or improving our internal tools and processes.</p></font>\n              ",

We're looking for a talented software engineer who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.</p><p>You'll be working alongside a small, driven team right in the heart of the profit center.  Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I'd bet you a beer we've served ads on nearly every site you've ever visited.</p><p>We're primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It's used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It's not just boring CRUD. It's the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you'll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.</p><p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you'd get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms). It's really possible to get bored around here unless you're a boring person.</p><p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you've got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that's a good start. More importantly, you'll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.</p><p>We're a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.</p><p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.</p></font>\n              ",

We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly.</p><p>As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We're currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).</p><p>We looking for four main strengths in you:</p><p>\u25e6 <i>skill:</i> your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.</p><p>\u25e6 <i>desire to learn:</i> despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.</p><p>\u25e6 <i>understanding:</i> our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.</p><p>\u25e6 <i>clear communication:</i> We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.</p><p>Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.</p><p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.</p><p>So, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

Our Digital Supply Chain Director service enables continuous, automatic, and real-time Voice of the Customer analysis, identifying any sources of service misbehaviour and directing attention where improvement in experience for staff and customers will be most meaningful. Our service is being incorporated into digital product architectures and processes for some of the world\u2019s largest, most sophisticated digital enterprises.</p><p>To give a concrete example: 95% of a web-page may load in a fraction of a second, but the quality of the user-experience is adversely affected by the last image (or javascript, or whatever) taking 3 seconds to arrive from the CDN.  Our software captures this kind of measurement and helps identify the cause.  It's not limited to web-pages; we have measurement profiles for email, database, VoIP, cloud services etc.  We can also help identify where the service is <i>too</i> good, where the additional speed is essentially wasted and, perhaps, the investment would be better made in other areas of an infrastructure.</p><p>You can see the technology in action with our consumer version, BbFix.

You care about and are proud of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.</p><p>Test-Driven Development is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use \"lack of time\" as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.</p><p>You are a team player. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.</p><p>As a passionate developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.</p><p>As part of the learning process, you consider it important to share what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.</p><p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job without being religious about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms, user interface libraries and development environments.</p><p>You understand and embrace Agile processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.</p><p>You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of SOLID principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and Domain-Driven Design to design applications that reflect the business domain.</p><p>If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are definitely interested in hearing from you.</p><p><a href=\"http://codurance.com/careers/craftsman/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://codurance.com/careers/craftsman/</a> for more info</p></font>\n              ",

To be clear, the individual we hire will have full direction over the tech strategy, but that strategy will be designed and created as a result of the management goals, which this person will help establish.</p><p>We need someone who can innovate, plan, build, implement, and drive all of the company\u2019s tech initiatives, including coding.  While we have plans to build out a team underneath this person in the very near future, in the beginning, they will have to roll up their sleeves and code.  This is not a country club position in which they delegate.  This is a startup.  This individual will also be responsible for maintaining all aspects of our software, from debugging to taking preventative measures to ensure uptime.</p><p>This person\u2019s actions will directly shape the company.  Their stamp will be all over Wine Kloud.  This is a big role and requires someone with the experience and acumen to fill it.  We need someone who is passionate about building and problem solving.  Someone who can contribute to and incorporate the company vision.  Someone entrepreneurial in nature with the ability to lead and, ideally, successful startup experience.  And possibly most important, someone who is committed to the success of the organization.  We are not looking for a year-long commitment from someone.  We need someone onboard who will see out the company\u2019s success.</p><p>_____</p><p>TECH PROFILE:</p><p>Here\u2019s the tech stack that our developers are working with.  The ideal hire will know these well:</p><p>- Python</p><p>- Django</p><p>- MySQL</p><p>- Redis</p><p>- Celery</p><p>- Stream Framework</p><p>- Python Social Auth</p><p>- Apache</p><p>- 3rd Party Services like Payment Gateways</p><p>_____</p><p>Please submit your resume or address questions to info@winekloud.com.

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. We are going to Cambodia this fall...want to join us?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>\n              ",
