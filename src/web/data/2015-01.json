Those of us who enjoy what we do, and find satisfaction in our work take account of our accomplishments and achievements in the past year.  Others may be less satisfied with their current position, and resolve to improve it.  If you find yourself in the latter camp, my advice is to find a job for which you are passionate, motivated, and talented.  Find your muse; something which engages your heart and mind, and gives you a sense a fulfillment.</p><p>For those of us at Matasano Security, this sense of pride and accomplishment comes from assessing the security of application software.  We find few things as inately satisfying as discovering ways to abuse application logic and bend it to our will.  Better yet is the satisfaction that comes with knowing our clients can now use our information to secure their applications and protect their clients. It takes meticulous attention to detail, and the ability to think outside the box and consider cases the application's own developers didn't.  Application Security can be both an intriguing mental puzzle, and an extreme adrenaline rush in a way few disciplines of computing are.</p><p>In the coming weeks, gyms will fill up with new members intent on exercising their bodies.

It won't be this way for long, your computer has an incredible volume of data about you stored in email and in calendar so a world where this rich context is put to use is inevitable. We are doing just this -- building rich user profiles and analyzing the tasks each user needs to accomplish in real time -- so that when a user pulls out their phone, they are proactively presented with personalized solutions.</p><p>We are moving from a world where computers are tools people engage, to a world where computers proactively engage users with targeted decisions -- simplifying and automating life's daily tasks. This is a categorical shift in how we use computers and we have found early traction and growth via converting daily tasks into actions through large scale data processing of users email and calendar data.</p><p>Contact: wferrell AT weldai.com</p></font>",

Bringing companies to our hiring day, and getting them to happily leave with their new data science hire will be your job.</p><p>Does your network include lots of companies hiring data scientists? We need you. You have lived and worked in the US, preferrably in the Valley, and are plugged in.</p><p>The director of DSR cofounded a startup with a Ycombinator alumn, so it's not like we have zero network in the Valley, but this requires far more effort than we can allocate right now with the current team. If you are reading this from SF, and thinking about moving to Berlin, this is a good opportunity.</p><p>There are about 10x more data science jobs in the US than in EU, so our goal for the next batches is to serve the US market. We think the education we provide is top-notch, we just need to get noticed by companies hiring from the US.</p><p>If you are well-connected in EU, and know how to get to talk with exactly the right person at the right company: we need you.

Examples: Ted Dunning, Drew Conway, Adam Blake, Mikio Braun, etc\n-Potential for growth. If you get things done, you will be a permanent hire. If you generate exceptional value, you can be a cofounder.

Ardusat (<a href=\"https://www.ardusat.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ardusat.com</a>) is a growing educational technology company providing engaging experiences to science and math students by creating technology, products, and curriculum preparing them to run custom experiments on real satellites in space. With over $6B available in public and private STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) grants, this is an exciting space to work in.</p><p>========================================</p><p>Why Ardusat is an awesome place to work:</p><p>* Early stage startup with successful seed funding round. We've proven that investors and early adopters are excited about our vision, now we need help making that vision a reality! As part of a small team, you'll have the chance to make a real impact on the future direction of the company.</p><p>* Education is a space where what you are doing matters. Everyone at Ardusat is here because we believe parts of the education system are broken, and need to be fixed. We want our work to impact student's lives all over the world by cultivating more interest in math, science, and technology.</p><p>* We value autonomy, professional development, and life outside work. Do you do your best work when you get out skiing for the morning and work at 1 am? We understand different people work differently, and we want everyone we hire to be inspired by and love what they do. This means that we try to have people work on projects that are interesting to them, provide the resources to continue learning, and give the flexibility to fit in life outside work.</p><p>* Space is cool. So, you're not exactly a rocket scientist? Well, we don't actually work with rockets, either, but a satellite engineer is pretty close. We have a close partnership with San Francisco-based Spire and collaborate with their engineering team on a variety of projects. There's a good chance that some of the code you write at Ardusat will be running in space in a few months.</p><p>* Salt Lake City is not the Bay Area. We love visiting the Valley, but we're always pretty excited to get home. SLC is more affordable, has way less traffic, and, most importantly, is 30 minutes away from some of the best skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hiking in the country. We are proud to be located somewhere where access to the mountains is close enough that you don't have to be a weekend warrior. (We respect powder days)</p><p>===============</p><p>Jobs Available:</p><p>* Front End Developer - We need someone to help develop our various web-based tools. The ideal candidate would be comfortable creating great UX and familiar with modern JS frameworks (we currently use Angular.js) HTML5, CSS3. Experience developing mobile apps is a big plus. We work with a top notch design firm for our creative, but having a decent eye for design is important.</p><p>* Embedded Software Developer - We need a \u201cfull stack\u201d embedded hacker to help us develop some of our product offerings. Experience with typical \u201cmaker\u201d technologies (3D printing, proto-board prototyping, Arduino, etc.) is preferred. This is an important, early hire for the team, however, so it involves multiple hats, and we're also looking for someone with experience working with backend technologies including sys admin and backend web development (we use Rails and Node.js).</p><p>============</p><p>Technologies</p><p>We try not to be dogmatic about individual technologies. We've all used a lot of different platforms, languages, and idioms over our careers, so we're not overly focused on any particular technology/framework. However, we currently use/like the following technologies, and experience with some of them certainly helps!</p><p>Node.js</p><p>Ruby on Rails</p><p>Postgres</p><p>Angular.js</p><p>React.js</p><p>C</p><p>Arduinos</p><p>Docker</p><p>AWS</p><p>iOS/Android</p><p>============</p><p>How to Apply</p><p>If you think Ardusat sounds like an exciting place to work, we want to hear from you! Please email us at jobs@ardusat.com with a brief description of your background and why you are interested in Ardusat, as well as a portfolio/CV. We would like to see a non-trivial code sample that you feel showcases your coding abilities and experiences \u2013 whether that's a github profile, side project code sample, OSS contribution or something else. We'll try to get back to everyone as quickly as possible!</p></font>",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).</p><p>We are excited to hear from you!</p></font>",
