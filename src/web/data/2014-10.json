I returned to school almost twenty years ago and did quite well--but I had taken care of all my math requirements 15 years before that and my degree is about as far from math as one can get. So I had not seen the inside of a math classroom for more than thirty years when I decided not long ago that I wanted to review high school math. Listening to Sal's explanations have made this so easy it is as though I had remembered all of it this whole time!</p><p>I am disabled now, and have no means to continue formal studies in much of anything, but I am now learning the calculus and linear algebra I was planning on studying when I was much younger--before my college career ran off the rails for an extended time. Thank you Sal (and the internets) for letting me remain a student! Keep this place running; I want to be able to hang around here until I am no longer able to hang around anywhere anymore.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who are thankful for our free, high-quality educational content. Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>A few things we're currently working on building right now:</p><p>\u2013 The next version of our personalized learning dashboard [1] to make the UI more consistent across subjects and to help people learn better</p><p>\u2013 Improved knowledge models so we can better know what you know and don't know [2]</p><p>\u2013 Infrastructure improvements to make the site more reliable and faster for our millions of visitors every month [3]</p><p>\u2013 Better tools for our content creators to allow them to make thousands of engaging, interactive exercise problems without knowing how to code [4]</p><p>\u2013 A major revision to our iOS app to let students practice skills on the go (or in a classroom with iPads!)</p><p>You'll be part of a small team working alongside both \"celebrity\" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven't heard of but who are also really awesome.</p><p>==================================</p><p>We're especially looking for new product designers and mobile devs but we have a handful of other positions open -- take a look and see if anything suits you.</p><p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and mention that you're coming from HN.

These are services such as backup, push services, and account services.  As we build these services we're also helping expand the platforms; we're not satisfied until anyone can build the same kinds of services that we do on the web platform.  You'll be working together with a small team sharing a handful of projects.</p><p>Client development happens both in Gaia (the set of HTML and JavaScript applications that make up much of Firefox OS) and in Gecko (Mozilla's core platform that underlies Firefox on desktop, Android, and OS).  JavaScript will be the primary language you use, but this is not a JavaScript job.  Mozilla loves JavaScript so much that it uses JavaScript in ways that you are unlikely to be familiar with.  You should be open (even excited!) to work with large and complex codebases, and to work within the process that coordinates the Mozilla company and community.</p><p>Working at Mozilla is a unique opportunity:</p><p>1. Everything you do will be open source and in public repositories.\n2. You can be as open and public about your work as you choose: we strive to make our processes open within the company and beyond the company to the community and world.\n3. We love the web without reservation.  It's not that we just like hanging out with the web, or that we love what the web can do for us: Mozilla and the web are married for life.\n4. Mozilla is a mission-led organization.  That means lots of things, but part of what it means is that when you interact with people, or even disagree with them, you also know that we're here for the same reason and that we share a motivational foundation.\n5. Mozilla is super friendly to remote work.  And even if you don't want to start remote, this gives you options in the future.\n6. Mozilla is focused on its impact on the world, and we'll support you in your own ambitions to have impact.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>1. BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience; being able to show examples of your work is the best evidence.\n2. Experience with web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.\n3. Experience with methods common in open source world: version control, integration testing, etc.\n4. Mobile experience is a plus.\n5. Experience or readiness to interact with large codebases and distributed teams.\n6. Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</p><p>We are open to both junior and senior candidates for this position.</p><p>You can work remotely or in one of our regional offices (<a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/</a>).

The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country\u2019s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. There are also other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.</p><p>The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice based on our economic theories, and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level. If you're looking for a high-impact job, this is it!</p><p>================================</p><p>* What we want to do:</p><p>We want to focus on building features around this idea of storytelling with data (see example at the end), as well as re-do our UI and design to be cleaner and up to modern standards, and to add better visualization capabilities. We look at NYtimes / WaPo data driven articles with envy.

No late nights and weekends, although I've been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.</p><p>We're a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher, plus a new super talented designer), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral / postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I've been here only for a few months, but I've been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you'll have.</p><p>I'm looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality.

Rails Machine pays 100% of health insurance premiums, participates in 401k match and has been bootstrapped and profitable since our founding in 2006. All employees participate in quarterly profit sharing.</p><p>As a Site Reliability Engineer at Rails Machine, your goals will be to ensure our customer\u2019s applications are available, fast, and secure. Our customers need the best service, support, and products, and we need you to help us deliver.</p><p>At Rails Machine, we offer two main products: managed infrastructure and managed operations. Through managed infrastructure, we provide automation, infrastructure, and scalability in our own data center on our own hardware. We provide both bare-metal and virtualized hosting options for our customers, and you\u2019ll work directly with them to ensure their goals are met through automation, analysis, and hardware.</p><p>Via managed operations, we provide custom, consulting-based solutions on top of AWS and other cloud vendors, as best meets our customer\u2019s needs. You\u2019ll manage globally load balanced AWS installations, cross-datacenter replication on different vendors, or within customer\u2019s data-centers.</p><p>No matter the product, we take a DevOps-centric approach with our customers - we believe that we provide the best service and our customers get the best value when we work closely together. We integrate task trackers (Pivotal, Trello, Asana), chat (Slack, Hipchat), and source control (github) into our own workflow through careful and clever use of automation, giving our customers the ability to reach out to us like they would with an internal DevOps team but without an operational burden on us.</p><p>You\u2019ll work with virtualization and container technologies like Xen, OpenStack, Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. You will setup and automate high availability data clusters (MySQL Galera, PostgreSQL replication, Redis failover, ElasticSearch clustering, Memcached, MongoDB etc.), application instances for technologies like Ruby-on-Rails, Django, Node, and Scala (to name a few), and layer on top of those management, orchestration, monitoring, and alerting for fleets of instances.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years.</p><p>Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek.</p><p>I previously co-founded BuildASign.com, a bootstrapped custom printing ecommerce business set to do over $70M in 2014 revenues, and I left daily operations several years back to study biology, bioinformatics, machine learning and drug discovery. My co-founder, Chris, and I started Recursion to turn drug discovery into a computational problem. Our vision is ambitious (zero-to-one scale), and early results are compelling.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Lead Data Scientist (Python):</p><p>- You have several years of experience in statistics, machine learning, and software development solving problems using lots of data, preferably using python\u2019s scientific stack. You see the world through the lens of statistics and modeling, you thoroughly understand cross-validation and learning curves, and you can explore data on your own and get an effective guess as to what sort of model and assumptions make sense as a starting point.</p><p>- You\u2019re motivated both by tackling the most challenging data problems around, and by making lots of patients\u2019 lives dramatically better.</p><p>- Maybe you already know some biology, but if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re excited to learn what you need to (we\u2019ll help, of course!) in order to really understand our data and approach.</p><p>- You\u2019ll come to understand our experiments and data at a visceral level and help us guide the direction of our experiments and our company towards our goals.</p><p>- You\u2019ll work with our biologists to guide our design/experiment/analyze cycle towards getting the most impactful biological information from the most rapid and cost-effective experimental approaches. This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of experiments. You\u2019ll set the groundwork for how we\u2019ll design and analyze thousands of experiments in the coming years.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Software Engineer (Python):</p><p>- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You\u2019re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.</p><p>- You\u2019re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients\u2019 lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.</p><p>- You\u2019ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we\u2019ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.</p><p>&gt;&gt; About Recursion:</p><p>We work in a beautiful office and lab space set directly at the base of the mountains, overlooking Salt Lake City, situated directly one floor above the drug discovery core at the University of Utah, giving us direct access to millions of dollars of cutting edge lab automation and imaging equipment. We offer competitive pay, health insurance, relocation assistance (working at the office is part of the deal), equity, a location 30 minutes from amazing mountains and 5 world-class ski resorts, and a group of ambitious, talented, happy, awesome people to work with.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.recursionpharma.com/careers.html</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.recursionpharma.com/lead-python-data-scientist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.recursionpharma.com/lead-python-data-scientist.ht...</a></p></font>",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We are in Portugal right now! Want to come?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

Interesting things, useful things, cool things. It's like building with Legos, only you get paid, and there are always plenty of the right color pieces.</p><p>At TechEmpower, we build things. Interesting things. Cool things, mostly in webapp form. We build them as individuals, because we're creative people. We build them as teams, because we like to help each other grow, and because we know that collaboration improves even the best code.</p><p>Having the best people doesn't hurt, either. We've got most of them already, and we're looking to find the rest. You can build things with us. What's the catch? We're pretty darn selective.</p><p>To work as an individual, you have to be motivated and creative and thoughtful and serious. To work on a team, you have to be respectful and energetic and open and absolutely not a jerk. We need developers who can work on every part of an application, from the data store to the page\u2013sometimes known as full stack developers. And to be a full stack developer, you have to know technology and want to learn more technology, because those acronyms just keep coming.</p><p>Our clients expect us to work with them, not for them. We help them define their problems, and we provide solutions, on time and on target. We're service-oriented, and you should be too.</p><p>Still reading? Please apply!

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.</p><p>We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.</p><p>We're a rapidly growing startup (you'd be #19), but well funded ($6M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

We believe while hardware architecture changed drastically almost a decade ago, software hasn't caught up. Current software clashes with hardware, and requires more effort to be expended on scaling rather than on business logic. The problem is most severe in server-side software that ingests real-time data, and needs to respond to a very large number of concurrent requests at low latencies. It facilitates software that is harmonious with modern hardware -- with multi-core and multi-cache, with the storage hierarchy and the IO-to-processing ratio -- rather than software that fights the hardware at every turn. The result is applications that require far less hardware, while at the same time provide much greater performance and headroom for growth.</p><p>As a developer evangelist, your job would be to help drive adoption of the Parallel Universe stack. The job is a mix of marketing, coding, sales, and geeking out. On the job you will:</p><p>* Write demos and benchmarks, and blog about them</p><p>* Write introductory blog posts and tutorials</p><p>* Speak at (and organize) developer events and hosted tech-talks</p><p>* Study the problems facing potential users, and help direct our software to best address those problems</p><p>* Provide support and guidance on technical forums and social media</p><p>* Provide on-site support and guidance for customers</p><p>* Build and cultivate relationships with US companies</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>* Experience writing software for the JVM, especially in Java (knowing Clojure is a plus)</p><p>* Strong familiarity with modern server-side architectures</p><p>* Participation in developer communities</p><p>* Strong technical writing skills</p><p>* Public speaking experience</p><p>* Strong social skills and an outgoing personality</p><p>* Residence in the San Francisco Bay Area</p><p>You will work from home, but travel in the Bay Area (and occasionally in the rest of the US) to visit companies and participate in events.

Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n\n  - We run a makerspace in our building (http://grmakers.com), which gives us\n    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<p></p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software developer on this awesome team.
