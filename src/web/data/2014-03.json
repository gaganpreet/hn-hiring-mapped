We got a great response on this back in January and now we are expanding.... So here is an updated version now that we are a team of two hiring.</p><p>Hey, HN. One of you is perfect for this idea.</p><p>We are two serial entrepreneurs currently trapped in the professions of being a freelance contractor. We have relatively stable 40 hour a week projects, and incoming projects as well that I generally can't take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)</p><p>So here's the idea.\nYou. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.\nI would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.\n(also now looking for 40 hours)</p><p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.</p><p>Here is what you get.\nMoney\nFreedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)\nReal World Education\nAbility to become a killer coder\nand whatever else. we are pretty flexible</p><p>Languages?\nPython/Ruby Obj-C Javascript(Node)\nYou name it.\nIf you can show competency in some language we currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.</p><p>About us, your 'bosses'.\nBoss #1 (Portland Office)\nEarly 30s. Built several large-scale enterprise applications used by Fortune 500 companies. Lead engineering and product for a VC-funded healthcare startup. Last company built infrastructure that stored over 1 billion objects and transferred hundreds thousand objects per day.</p><p>Currently living in PDX (Inner SE) and renting a space at a co-working facility. Open to having you work here, or at my house. I prefer day hours, 10-6pm PST, but I am flexible.</p><p>Boss #2 (New York Office)\nLate 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the 'valley'. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.</p><p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.\nI have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.</p><p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.</p><p>==============\ntl;dr\nLong story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.</p><p>You'll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).</p><p>We'll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.</p><p>email hn0314@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.</p></font>",

We generated $333,000 in February, and we have $520,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I'm sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I'd love for you to be part of the incredible journey we've embarked upon.</p><p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we're seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we'd love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.</p><p>Do any of these areas stand out for you? I'd really love to hear from you:</p><p></p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we're sending 400,000 posts to social networks every day,\n      our architecture is still not ideal)\n    - Happiness (Support) Hacker (we have a crazy obsession for customer happiness\n      and want to build our own tools to go beyond what's normal)\n    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million downloads but currently no\n      full-time developer!)\n    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are all crying out for an\n      iPad app)\n    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%, we'd love your help\n      improving it and many other metrics)\n    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used Buffer, we'd love to improve\n      our dashboard interface and extensions for them)\n</code></pre>\nSome of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p></p><pre><code>    - We're completely open about salary and equity, in fact here is a spreadsheet\n      of all individual salaries: https://docs.google.com/a/bufferapp.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=1.\n      It's most likely you'd fall into a range of $85,000-$120,000 and 0.1%-1%.\n    - We're a fully distributed remote team, and we come together 3 times a year for\n      super fun retreats. The last one was in Thailand in December, our next is\n      Cape Town in April!\n    - We have a big focus on culture, that's the main thing we think about when someone\n      joins the team. Here is our slide deck of values: http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-03 \n</code></pre>\nI'll read through emails with our CTO Sunil, I hope yours might be part of that.

When I was 19 years old I was kicked out of a great university because I had terrible grades. My disappointed parents cut me off financially so I began working night shifts to support myself. The truth is, I had no desire to go to school because learning had always seemed very distant from reality to me. ... Success in school felt like something you either had or you didn't, and I had been getting Cs since middle school\u2026.I stumbled across [your] videos about math. I HATED math. I watched them anyway. I don't know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I'm 24 now, and I'm in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As. Sal's videos made me feel like I had the capacity for understanding math and science even though my parents never sent me to space camp and I never won a ribbon at a science fair in elementary school...</p><p>==================================</p><p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who're thankful for free, high-quality educational content.</p><p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.</p><p>And now we're doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We're totally overhauling our iOS app.</p><p>If you join us now, you can be a core developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.</p><p>You'll be part of a small team working alongside both \"celebrity\" devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more of us normal folk ;) you haven't heard of but who are workin' hard to help education.</p><p>Apply at <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> and be sure to mention that you're coming from HN.

Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43\n\n  - If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit about you:<p></p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n</code></pre>\nI'm a software craftsman on this awesome team.

We\u2019re Red Hot Labs from San Francisco and we're looking for a FULL-TIME DEV and a FULL-TIME ADMIN/GENERALIST.<p>We're on a mission to revolutionize how mobile developers harness their data.  Our product, still in beta, functions as the central hub for all the services mobile developers already use.  By weaving together the data from these disparate services, we gain a comprehensive view of the app and are uniquely positioned to deliver insights and value back to the developer.</p><p>This isn't our first trip around the block.  Our previous startup was acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the rest of Zynga\u2019s most successful games.  It was a wild ride and now we\u2019re full steam ahead on a new adventure. We're well backed by folks such as A16Z, Greylock, SVAngel, DCVC, and more.</p><p>We're looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented engineers to join our team.  By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We\u2019re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.</p><p>We want all engineering members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we're especially excited about the following engineering profiles:</p><p>==================================</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Senior Product Engineer: You've built products from  concept all the way to \n  maturity.  You're as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  \n  You're a master at JS/CSS/HTML and customer facing technologies. \n  Bonus points if you\u2019re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular \n  (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.\n\n  - Senior Systems Engineer: You've architected and scaled backend systems to \n  millions of users.  You've put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the \n  process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server \n  architectures, and low-level services. \n\n  - Senior Data Engineer: You've built models which extract insights or \n  predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an \n  unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area \n  experts with your result.  \n\n  - Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don't have years of working experience, but \n  you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.  You were among \n  the best students at a top tier engineering university. Your TA's and \n  classmates gush about your code.\n\n</code></pre>\nOUR STACK:<p></p><pre><code>  - Redis, MySQL, Rails for our backend API.\n  - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.\n  - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore, Node.JS with D3 for our dashboard and web apps.\n  - 3rd party services: Facebook, Mixpanel, Stripe, Mailgun\n</code></pre>\n==================================<p>In addition, we're hiring for an admin/generalist position. We're looking for someone that doesn't necessarily know how to code (if you're interested in learning we can definitely help you there!), but is passionate about startups and is competent and considerate in any task thrown their way. This role would be to support the rest of the team to help with marketing, sales, general office admin stuff, scheduling interviews, QA, and so on. Basically, all of the \"other stuff\" in a startup.</p><p>Do any of the above profiles sound like you?

We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers focusing on strategy and/or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.</p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.</p><p>Learn more at <a href=\"http://amacapital.net/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.</p></font>",

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:</p><p>1st class engineer\u00a0</p><p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo\u2019d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they\u2019re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You\u2019ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura &amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You\u2019ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs &amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You\u2019ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality</p><p>Data hungry\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You\u2019ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You\u2019ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you\u2019ve helped architect.</p><p>Open all hours\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you\u2019ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you\u2019ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.</p><p>Solver of riddles\u00a0</p><p>You won\u2019t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you\u2019ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn\u2019t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.</p><p>Getting shit done\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren\u2019t perfect, but you\u2019ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You\u2019ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.</p><p>Commercially aware\u00a0</p><p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You\u2019ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn\u2019t fall over as its user base scales. You\u2019ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.</p><p>Keen eye, tuned ear\u00a0</p><p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We\u2019ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You\u2019ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You\u2019ll know that most project budgets don\u2019t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you\u2019re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.</p><p>Security and speed\u00a0</p><p>You\u2019ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You\u2019ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we\u2019re after. But then you already know that.</p><p>About We Are Base</p><p>We're a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.</p><p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable.\u00a0Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.</p><p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We\u2019re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.</p><p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.</p><p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.</p><p><a href=\"http://wearebase.com/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wearebase.com/hiring</a></p></font>",

We use a combination of weather monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide real-time pricing and purchasing of customizable weather insurance to farmers in the United States.<p>Climate's technical staff numbers around 80, and we're hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:</p><p>1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.</p><p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics/ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.</p><p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.</p><p>The scale and interdiscplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very important problems.</p><p>Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is lumped into two-week sabbaticals.

        "full_html": "<font color=\"#000000\">Academia.edu, San Francisco, CA<p>Academia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.</p><p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.</p><p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.</p><p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.\"</p><p>Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.\nIf you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.</p><p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.

This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.</p><p>We're looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we've got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.</p><p>So far this year, we've built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive's gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We're currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].</p><p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don't realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world's largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.</p><p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website \u2013 whatever will best display the work that you\u2019ve done.

We don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is a plus.</p><p>We're also looking for someone at the CTO level.</p><p>DaisyBill is located at 34 W 15th Street in Manhattan. We're a SaaS vendor serving the workers' compensation e-billing market.</p><p>Workers' comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical e-billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that treats the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.</p><p>DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.</p><p>You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.</p><p>The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.</p><p>We use Git for source control and use Macs for development. We develop in an agile manner in the style of ThoughtWorks and Pivotal Labs, using Pivotal Tracker. We like our code to have tests, and as such we have an extensive suite covering the Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript code on the site.</p><p>Please send all inquiries to jobs@daisybill.com.</p></font>",

Taskflow.io collects data on each step a business process, so nothing falls between the cracks and process performance can be easily tracked.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION\nYou will be responsible for two things generating clients and keeping them happy.

The industry is ripe for innovation! We're building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for over 6 months now! I know 'app for laundry' is a tech clich\u00e9 right now, but we're definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we're solving it.</p><p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading cleaning operations, a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition, and a former Army Ranger managing our driver corps. I'm Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.</p><p>We're looking for a Full-Stack Developer to develop interactivity for our customers and tools for our staff. We're doing things like route scheduling and planning, e-commerce funnel optimization, and analytics gathering for data-driven decision making.</p><p>We're also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and 'growth hacking.' We're building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business. Please see a job description at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1dLJigo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/1dLJigo</a> - The sky's the limit!</p><p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.</p><p>MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. While we aren't a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you'll enjoy actually going home on time!</p><p>We have many openings, both technical and non-technical.</p><p>* Senior iOS Architect</p><p>* Senior Android Architect</p><p>* Software Architect</p><p>* System Administrator</p><p>* Director of Software Development</p><p>* QA Tester for Mobile Applications</p><p>* Sales Director (Digital Advertising Sales) in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco</p><p>You can apply directly here: <a href=\"http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2</a>\nOr you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com.
