When I was looking for my next role, I was focused on industries that were certainly going to change in the next 5 years: VR, insurance, transportation and eSports.

Transportation is nearly 10% of US GDP.<p>Smartcar is building the open source standard for telematics in the car. We enable dorm room startups to Fortune 500 insurance companies to buid applications on the car. Developers using the platform can create a service that automatically fuels up a driver&#x27;s car without the driver even having to know by accessing the telematics in the vehicle.<p>We&#x27;re a well funded startup, have revenue and a great team hailing from Google and LinkedIn looking to add 3 more. Since last month, we&#x27;ve been moved quickly with customers (can talk about it over the phone) and need help with development.<p>Your voice will be heard and you will determine the company\u2019s future technical roadmap.

Our long-term goal is to enable a completely autonomous economy by providing companies with tools that make it simple to build machines that automate the transaction process. We\u2019re a venture backed company with a strong founding team from UC Berkeley (our founders grew out of the CS PhD program).<p>We\u2019re looking for a full stack developer who wants to develop extremely reliable, clean, well-tested, and downright beautiful systems. We\u2019ve found that a very productive and powerful way to do this is to write code that writes our code for us: <i></i>autogeneration<i></i> is the foundation of DotDashPay, and in this paradigm you can become a 100x engineer (building on top of our autogenerators will allow you to ship new features in hours instead of weeks).<p>On top of our autogeneration framework, we write most of our complex features in a combination of C, C++, and Go (golang). We are currently using Node.js as our web backend language and are migrating our frontend to React. Strong experience in at least a couple of these languages, and the desire to learn the others, is important to us.<p>Desirable characteristics:<p>* Polyglot programmer: we have APIs in almost every major language that are autogenerated from our specification. The APIs require small glue code that is written in the target language and needs to conform to the standards &#x2F; conventions of that language.<p>* Experience building&#x2F;managing infrastructure: as a small team, everyone helps build and manage our infrastructure. We use many modern tools and services (Docker, Ansible, AWS) and strive to build things the Right Way\u2122, so we\u2019re always open to trying a new ideas and tools.<p>* Security experience: our payment systems must support some of the biggest names in retail, and our codebase undergoes rigorous security testing and certifications. A strong understanding of security best practices helps ensure that our products ship faster and our customers can rely on our software.<p>* Experience &#x2F; interest in payments: payments is a surprisingly fascinating and complex iceberg. Even if you know very little now, a desire to learn more is important as it pervades most of what we do.<p>Please email Sean Arietta via sean (at) dotdashpay (dot) com to set up a time for an initial chat.",

Our mobile applications are built with Xamarin, and our web app is built with React, but we don&#x27;t necessarily care if you&#x27;ve worked with either before as long as you&#x27;re a good programmer who&#x27;s interested in (and reasonably good at) learning new things.<p>A job at SiteDocs means:<p>* Being responsible for your own piece of the product. We&#x27;re a relatively small team, and our product is relatively young, so the features and components you build will have a meaningful impact on our users&#x27; experiences.<p>* The opportunity to teach (for senior developers) and to learn (for junior developers). Our company values continuous learning, and as a dev team we are more than happy to hire and train programmers right out of university (or self taught, etc).<p>* Market salary. However, we&#x27;re a Canadian company and our dollar is not doing very well these days, so it is currently difficult for us to pay in markets that demand more than $100k USD. I know that&#x27;s a completely reasonable salary, but we&#x27;re just not there at the moment and don&#x27;t want to waste your time :) As a remote team, it is more feasible for us to hire people in low cost-of-living areas and pay them slightly above-market for their location--note, however, that we&#x27;re limited to employees working in North American time zones at the moment.<p>Our hiring process is as follows:<p>1. Email application.<p>2. 15 minute screening call with me.<p>3. Online programming test at testdome.com. It&#x27;s a fairly tough test, with questions in a few different programming languages (the intent is not to bias our process towards experience with any particular language).<p>4. Short (one page) writing sample. We value written communication a lot.<p>5. Group conversation (over Google Hangouts) with some other members of the team. This is largely assessing oral communication.<p>Yes, there are several steps, but the entire process only adds up to about 5 hours of your time, and the plus side is you&#x27;ll be joining a remote team that truly values programming competence AND communication skill.<p>If you&#x27;d like to talk, please email dave.noel@sitedocs.com with &quot;HN Hiring&quot; in the subject line.",

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic&#x27;s central, highly automated &#x27;biocenter&#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>We&#x27;re a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

Since we\u2019re building a fully serverless stack, which is a fairly new thing, there are a lot of opportunities to solve new problems around development and deployment too, like how do we automate deployment to AWS Lambda, how do we do tests, how do we manage code, etc, so you\u2019ll be helping us figure out how to do that too.<p>We\u2019re a fairly new company, so there will be a lot of freedom but also plenty of guidance if wanted.  Code reviews are usually a pleasant learning experience.<p>* To apply:  Send an email to {anything}@jedberg.net (be creative!) with the subject &quot;job application&quot;.  In the email tell us why we should hire you over any other applicant.  What makes you better or more driven?  How will contribute in a way that no one else can?  How will you increase our diversity (and by diversity we don\u2019t mean gender and race, we mean diversity in life experience and culture and opinions).<p>Then please attach a code sample of code you wrote the majority of, the more substantive the better.  If it\u2019s public, just send the link, and if it\u2019s private, add it as an attachment or add github.com&#x2F;jedberg as a reader, as long as you have permission to share from the owner (no secret corporate code please!).<p>We don\u2019t care much about resumes \u2014 if you have one send it along, or just a link to your LinkedIn or equivalent is fine too.<p>If we like what you wrote, we\u2019ll offer you an interview, which will be a video chat where we\u2019ll talk about what you wrote in your email, and then ask you questions about the code you submitted.<p>Why CloudNative:<p>* We\u2019re just starting out so you get to play a big part in the direction of our product and company culture<p>* Our founder (me) is an AWS Hero, as well as one of our advisors, and our other advisor wrote boto and the AWS command line.<p>* We\u2019re building on a totally serverless stack with AWS Lambda, DynamDB, ElasticSearch and GitHub.",

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Moving between divisions, temporarily or permanently, is possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica&#x2F;LA, Palo Alto, Seattle, Beaverton, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Austin, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Sydney, Berlin, Singapore and Beijing, with more coming.<p>We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>You can see the available jobs and apply through our website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotal.io&#x2F;careers</a>.

To help meet this goal, the program will train qualified candidates to have immediate, meaningful impact as data scientists in some of the top data startups in the world. This program will hone their skills in statistics, machine-learning, programming, and product development by presenting them with real-world challenges put forth by startups in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.<p>What We Offer: \nCatenus Science offers a fully-paid, 13-week apprenticeship during which we reinforce technical and business skills. We do this via a mix of formal instruction and hands-on application of data science in some of the best startups in the world.\nEvery startup is different, and each has its own unique culture and opportunities. That is why we want to give apprentices exposure to several places so they can find the right fit. Apprentices will have the opportunity to do rotations through three startups in a three month period while receiving training and mentorship the entire time. These startups will have well-scoped, immediately impactful data science problems for apprentices to solve.\nThe program is structured such that apprentices have four days a week of full-time employment at a startup and one day a week of instruction. Apprentices are expected to already be knowledgable in data science, so we view these instructions as a way to hone their skills. In addition, we will use this time for apprentices to present the problems they are working on to the group. This way they can teach about new insights and seek help when faced with obstacles.<p>Who We Are Looking For:\nWe are looking for candidates who posses technical virtuosity, communication skills, and business sense to use data in impactful ways.\nNecessary, but not sufficient, mathematical skills include a mastery of statistics and machine learning, and the ability to tell the difference between these two fields. Apprentices should have the hacking proficiency to code any idea regardless of programming language.\nNobody can understand those who cannot communicate. You should be able to clearly convey your thoughts, both in writing and orally. Communication does not end at expressing yourself, though. We expect apprentices who recognize the strengths of new ideas by listening to and understanding others.\nFinally, we have seen time and time again that the best data scientists are ruthlessly pragmatic. The ones creating state-of-the-art products understand the domain-problems they are solving and how to deliver those solutions efficiently. Apprentices should be able to formulate solutions to relevant business problems with data science tools. Furthermore, they should be able to identify new business opportunities by looking at data.<p>Learn more and apply:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com</a><p>Contact us:\nfrancisco@catenus.com",
