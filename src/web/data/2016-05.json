A small team (6-10) will conceive and prototype a game concept, eventually growing to a production team of 20-30 developers. (Nexon is currently best known for F2P mobile games, but that is not the focus of this incubator team.)<p>My name&#x27;s Kevin Saunders and I&#x27;m leading this new initiative at Nexon. (Games I&#x27;ve worked on in the past include Shattered Galaxy (MMORTS), Command &amp; Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer, and Torment: Tides of Numenera.) I am currently seeking candidates to form the core of this new studio within Nexon. This is an opportunity to work in a small team environment and help establish a new product and a team culture, but with the support of an established corporation.<p>We will begin from an existing engine, such as Unity or Unreal. You will be a&#x2F;the key technical voice within this team.<p>Depending upon your interests, you will be either a senior engineer&#x2F;architect for the prototype (and later the game) or a lead programmer who grows and mentors a small team of engineers. (In this latter case, you&#x27;ll still be writing code, at least during the prototyping phase.)<p>5+ years of programming experience, please. Previous professional game development experience NOT required, but please have significant experience with one or more game engines. (I have had some great experiences working with programmers who wanted to transition from other industries, but in these cases game development was at least a hobby.) I&#x27;m looking for the right person&#x2F;people more than I&#x27;m looking for a specific skill profile.<p>Salary: $120+K\nComprehensive benefits package, including unlimited vacation time<p>Casual inquiries are OK. Let us know what you&#x27;re interests are and what you&#x27;ve been working on. We are a small group within Nexon and so our interview practices are still evolving, but coding tests are not part of our process.<p>If you may be interested, please contact Aaron Morrison (amorrison@nexon.net).

We\u2019ve found that a very productive and powerful way to do this is to write code that writes our code for us: <i></i>autogeneration<i></i> is the foundation of DotDashPay, and in this paradigm you can become a 100x engineer (building on top of our autogenerators will allow you to ship new features in hours instead of weeks).<p>On top of our autogeneration framework, we write most of our complex features in a combination of C, C++, and Go (golang). We are currently using Node.js as our web backend language and are migrating our frontend to React. Strong experience in at least a couple of these languages, and the desire to learn the others, is important to us.<p>Desirable characteristics:<p>* Polyglot programmer: we have APIs in almost every major language that are autogenerated from our specification. The APIs require small glue code that is written in the target language and needs to conform to the standards &#x2F; conventions of that language.<p>* Experience building&#x2F;managing infrastructure: as a small team, everyone helps build and manage our infrastructure. We use many modern tools and services (Docker, Ansible, AWS) and strive to build things the Right Way\u2122, so we\u2019re always open to trying a new ideas and tools.<p>* Security experience: our payment systems must support some of the biggest names in retail, and our codebase undergoes rigorous security testing and certifications. A strong understanding of security best practices helps ensure that our products ship faster and our customers can rely on our software.<p>* Experience &#x2F; interest in payments: payments is a surprisingly fascinating and complex iceberg. Even if you know very little now, a desire to learn more is important as it pervades most of what we do.<p>Please email Sean Arietta via sean (at) dotdashpay (dot) com to set up a time for an initial chat.",

Our mobile applications are built with Xamarin, and our web app is built with React, but we don&#x27;t necessarily care if you&#x27;ve worked with either before as long as you&#x27;re a good programmer who&#x27;s interested in (and reasonably good at) learning new things.<p>A job at SiteDocs means:<p>* Being responsible for your own piece of the product. We&#x27;re a relatively small team, and our product is relatively young, so the features and components you build will have a meaningful impact on our users&#x27; experiences.<p>* The opportunity to teach (for senior developers) and to learn (for junior developers). Our company values continuous learning, and as a dev team we are more than happy to hire and train programmers right out of university (or self taught, etc).<p>* Market salary. However, we&#x27;re a Canadian company and our dollar is not doing very well these days, so it is currently difficult for us to pay in markets that demand more than $100k USD. I know that&#x27;s a completely reasonable salary, but we&#x27;re just not there at the moment and don&#x27;t want to waste your time :) As a remote team, it is more feasible for us to hire people in low cost-of-living areas and pay them slightly above-market for their location--note, however, that we&#x27;re limited to employees working in North American time zones at the moment.<p>Our hiring process is as follows:<p>1. Email application.<p>2. 15 minute screening call with me.<p>3. Online programming test at testdome.com. It&#x27;s a fairly tough test, with questions in a few different programming languages (the intent is not to bias our process towards experience with any particular language).<p>4. Short (one page) writing sample. We value written communication a lot.<p>5. Group conversation (over Google Hangouts) with some other members of the team. This is largely assessing oral communication.<p>Yes, there are several steps, but the entire process only adds up to about 5 hours of your time, and the plus side is you&#x27;ll be joining a remote team that truly values programming competence AND communication skill.<p>If you&#x27;d like to talk, please email dave.noel@sitedocs.com with &quot;HN Hiring&quot; in the subject line.",

We\u2019re hoping to bring a couple of experienced people onboard to help us build serious games in the healthcare industry, specifically in the rehab space. We use video games to help people get back on their feet after they\u2019ve broken themselves via sprains, breaks, falls, or surgery. Come use your software development super-powers to help people feel better!\nWe&#x27;re looking for two important hires: The first is a database &amp; network engineer to help us scale our current system to deal with the increased server load as we continually get more customers. This position requires serious experience with PostgreSQL, setting up failover, replication, and load balancing on the server, and writing backend Python code to interface with the server web-framework (we use CherryPy). You&#x27;ll also need experience setting up and administering a Linux VPS through AWS (mostly) or Azure (not as much).<p>The second position is a Unity3D engineer. For this position you must have substantial experience in Unity3D and C#, and have reasonable 3D math skills. Python experience is a huge plus but not required.<p>For both of these positions we\u2019re looking for people who are self-directed and like working with cool technologies in ways that haven\u2019t been used before. This job will definitely stretch your brain.<p>These jobs are located in Portland, Oregon, and would require relocation here, with assistance provided to the right candidates. We offer great salaries, great benefits, and a chance to work on projects that actually make people feel better. We work sane hours and don&#x27;t throw around words like rockstar or ninja to describe our team. Work&#x2F;life balance is extremely important to us.<p>If any of this sounds good and you fit the descriptions of what we&#x27;re looking for, send your resume &amp; any relevant links to jobs@respondwell.com and we&#x27;ll take it from there.",

For the operations team, we&#x27;re looking to hire an SRE or a sysadmin.  We&#x27;re open to a remote employee for this team.  We run one-week on-call shifts, so you&#x27;ll need to be on-call once every six or seven weeks.  The operations team is responsible for monitoring and maintaining about 800 servers (hardware is all handled by a different team).  We&#x27;re mostly running Ubuntu today, but we&#x27;re in the middle of migrating our first service into coreos&#x2F;kubernetes.  We&#x27;ve got some legacy code in Perl, and most new code we write is in Go.  Our biggest projects planned for the next year involve containerization, network storage, and possibly investigating migrating the most-elastic parts of our workload into amazon or google&#x27;s cloud.  We&#x27;re open to non-coding contributors in a sysadmin role instead of SRE.  For a remote employee, we&#x27;d want you to come on-site for the initial spin-up process.<p>For the Android and iOS teams, I know we&#x27;d love someone with 3d experience.  I don&#x27;t think those teams are very interested in a remote member.<p>The web services team writes mostly PHP and Haskell.  This is working on the backend supporting our mobile, web, and native clients.<p>Our hiring process usually involves a couple of casual phone screens, then a series of on-site interviews.<p>The company runs a chat service and a marketplace for users to make and sell 3d content to each other.

Knowledge in implementing network security (e.g. applying state-of-the-art encryption) and testing for common security mistakes is also very welcome.

We&#x27;re solving a hard but interesting problem: health data exchange. We ingest health data from thousands of sources and transform that data into an API that developers can build apps on.  This allows thousands of developers to create apps that improve peoples&#x27; lives. Our investors include a16z, Eric Schmidt, Blue Run Ventures, Max Levchin, Scott Banister, and Alex Payne.<p>== What you will build ==<p>Human API is the easiest way to integrate health data from anywhere.

However, we gravitate toward using the right tool for the job. Experience with some of the following is required:<p><pre><code>  - Stream processing and unified log systems with Kafka and RabbitMQ\n  - Mongodb, Redis and Cassandra for data storage\n  - Data analysis with Spark or Python tools\n  - Building and scaling a modern infrastructure stack with Docker and Mesos\n  - Building consumer focused apps and&#x2F;or developer focused tools\n  - Powering search with ElasticSearch and related tools\n  - Building a performant mobile UI using React\n</code></pre>\nYou can read more about some of the open roles here: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanapi.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;join\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanapi.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;join</a><p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you even if you don&#x27;t &quot;fit&quot; one of the job specs -- we hire for people, not roles.

This Sunday you&#x27;ll call your mother, or if she lives nearby, pay her a visit. She&#x27;ll passive aggressively suggest lifestyle alterations that will likely lead to the creation of a grandchild in her life, and you&#x27;ll smile and nod. Why not change the conversation this year? Tell her about that amazing job opportunity in the field of information security that you&#x27;ll be applying for so she can be proud and perplexed at the same time! You can stop scrolling. You&#x27;ve found that opportunity with NCC Group!<p>If you\u2019re a tinkerer, you enjoy breaking more than building, or someone who wonders \u201cwhy\u201d and ends up down the rabbit hole 36 hours later with a disassembled air conditioning unit surrounding them... we\u2019d love to hear from you! Our process welcomes those with years of experience, as well as those with little to no direct experience in what we do.<p>The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.<p>What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things).

Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers&#x2F;architects and your findings&#x2F;ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer.<p>All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time.

We enable scientists to run experiments on our automated work cells via our web application from anywhere in the world. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic&#x27;s central, highly automated &#x27;biocenter&#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We&#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges for our web devs range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, React, and CoffeeScript today, but you&#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>We&#x27;re a rapidly growing startup, now 30-something people, well funded ($15M) and have customers at places like Harvard, MIT, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford. You&#x27;d be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.<p>We&#x27;re looking for talented people to join our team. You&#x27;ll have competitive salary and benefits, subsidized commuting, free caffeine and food, and great teammates.<p>Our process takes 2-4 weeks, and includes 2 30-minute phone calls, a take-home exercise, and an onsite interview.

Having worked at a few different companies in my career, from large Fortune 100s to small 5 person startups I can honestly say that King is far and above the best working environment I have experienced. Kings culture is fantastic for allowing technical people the space to get on and do great things and we genuinely believe in looking after our people. We value having a good work life balance (even by Swedish standards). Then there are all the small things that make a big difference - choosing your own hardware, company wide gatherings every 6 months to share knowledge and have a party, interesting training and coaching opportunities as well as being encouraged to attend conferences.

Our MySQL cluster processes 1.1 M queries per second, our Application Servers respond to ~ 660k RPC calls per second and we have over 100 M daily active users. We lean towards writing a lot of our features ourselves rather than using libraries, we do make use of Open Source and encourage people to contribute back to projects they use and Open Source internal projects whenever possible.<p>Joining us has nothing do with where you\u2019re from, what you look like, your gender or what you wear. It\u2019s all about your talent, your potential and what you can achieve with us.

We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Moving between divisions, temporarily or permanently, is possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica&#x2F;LA, Palo Alto, Seattle, Beaverton, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Atlanta, Austin, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo, Sydney, Berlin, Singapore and Beijing, with more coming.<p>We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. We&#x27;re constantly improving the leading opensource PaaS -- our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i>.<p>Except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after three and a half years, we\u2019re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (20M kids), and 50,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 110 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.

To help meet this goal, the program will train qualified candidates to have immediate, meaningful impact as data scientists in some of the top data startups in the world. This program will hone their skills in statistics, machine-learning, programming, and product development by presenting them with real-world challenges put forth by startups in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.<p>What We Offer: \nCatenus Science offers a fully-paid, 13-week apprenticeship during which we reinforce technical and business skills. We do this via a mix of formal instruction and hands-on application of data science in some of the best startups in the world.\nEvery startup is different, and each has its own unique culture and opportunities. That is why we want to give apprentices exposure to several places so they can find the right fit. Apprentices will have the opportunity to do rotations through three startups in a three month period while receiving training and mentorship the entire time. These startups will have well-scoped, immediately impactful data science problems for apprentices to solve.\nThe program is structured such that apprentices have four days a week of full-time employment at a startup and one day a week of instruction. Apprentices are expected to already be knowledgable in data science, so we view these instructions as a way to hone their skills. In addition, we will use this time for apprentices to present the problems they are working on to the group. This way they can teach about new insights and seek help when faced with obstacles.<p>Who We Are Looking For:\nWe are looking for candidates who posses technical virtuosity, communication skills, and business sense to use data in impactful ways.\nNecessary, but not sufficient, mathematical skills include a mastery of statistics and machine learning, and the ability to tell the difference between these two fields. Apprentices should have the hacking proficiency to code any idea regardless of programming language.\nNobody can understand those who cannot communicate. You should be able to clearly convey your thoughts, both in writing and orally. Communication does not end at expressing yourself, though. We expect apprentices who recognize the strengths of new ideas by listening to and understanding others.\nFinally, we have seen time and time again that the best data scientists are ruthlessly pragmatic. The ones creating state-of-the-art products understand the domain-problems they are solving and how to deliver those solutions efficiently. Apprentices should be able to formulate solutions to relevant business problems with data science tools. Furthermore, they should be able to identify new business opportunities by looking at data.<p>Learn more and apply:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;catenus.com</a><p>Contact us:\nfrancisco@catenus.com",
