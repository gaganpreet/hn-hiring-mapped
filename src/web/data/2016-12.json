The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.\n- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.\nWe have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>Our stack is native Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C), our API is served in a Ruby on Rails monolith and Scala services, on top of MySQL, Cassandra, ElasticSearch and Spark. We are especially focusing on expanding our frontend team as we see significant growth on that side of the product. We are mostly Backbone + React, although some more complex state we are moving to Redux. It&#x27;s a very exciting time for the frontend, as we are planning to grow both in scale in terms of patient populations, as well as product use cases that require diverse interactions. It is super rewarding to see our product affect real people&#x27;s lives and the opportunity to reinvent this massive industry is enormous.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a> Also feel free to reach out to me at nam@wellframe.com!",

We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.<p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well.  We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.<p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.<p>We\u2019re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago.

In our view of the future, job candidates don\u2019t receive as much unsolicited outreach from recruiters.

It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resum\u00e9 says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.<p>We have <i>many</i> established offices worldwide (pivotal.io&#x2F;locations) and more coming.<p>We&#x27;re broken into three main divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Cloud R&amp;D and Big Data.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i> helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels.<p>-- <i>Cloud R&amp;D</i> is where we build the best cloud platform available: We&#x27;re the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project. Our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product <i>ever</i> and it&#x27;s <i>still</i> zooming up and to the right.<p>Except for upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform available.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is our suite of battled-hardened products, now open sourced. Greenplum tackles massive datasets with the comfort of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong isn&#x27;t mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles. More information about specific roles can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jet.com&#x2F;careers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jet.com&#x2F;careers</a> .
