What if you do not comply? Absolutely nothing. I will continue to do my best to parse your job post as it is.<p>To HN moderators. Apologies for highjacking the thread.

We believe effective communication involves more than chat rooms (though we use those too!). A big part of the mission I enjoy is that we are sparking cultural changes in our customers; to become transparent workplaces, with fewer silos and greater connections across the org chart from left to right and bottom to top.<p>Since winning TechCrunch in 2008 our growth has been exponential year over year. Over the last 4 years as a part of the Microsoft Office 365 suite, we&#x27;ve been quietly tying our systems together with the O365 fabric while continuing to improve the experience using our tried-and-true data-driven methods. We know everything we ship has an impact, and precisely how much.<p>We create with vim, SublimeText, IntelliJ, and GitHub; run on Macs and Ubuntu; write Swift &amp; ObjC, Java (Dropwizard), Python, and Ruby on Rails; manage PostgreSQL, HBase, RabbitMQ, Memcache, HAProxy, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Storm, Kibana, and Vertica clusters at scale; and automate using Puppet, Docker, Mesos, Marathon and Azure across physical data center &amp; cloud environments.<p>We have two floors in the &quot;Twitter building&quot; at 10th and Market in San Francisco, where we work next to the Outlook Mobile, MileIQ, Volumetrix, and other acquired startup teams. It&#x27;s a fantastic, open, creative space.<p>If San Francisco isn&#x27;t your thing, we have a large sibling team in Seattle (Redmond). We&#x27;re hiring for all roles in both locations!<p>Microsoft pays very competitively, invests in employees, and is highly supportive of a diverse and respectful workplace. It&#x27;s a startup atmosphere with the stability and maturity of a large company, which makes it a perfect balance for me.<p>If you have questions about a role I&#x27;d be happy to talk over email or in person.

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it\u2019s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.  Teachers know there\u2019s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we\u2019re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We\u2019ve grown fast: after four years, half of all schools in the US (65,000 schools) are using our platform.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We\u2019re a team of 120 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we\u2019re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Node and React.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.  We&#x27;re especially looking for a security-focused software engineer: a creative thinker who\u2019d be excited to help keep students\u2019 data safe.<p>Check us out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a>, or check out one of our product releases here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;badges</a>",

The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.\n- The reproducibility crisis. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the scientific literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis&quot;<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 14 million pdfs to Academia.edu, and upload about 1 million a month. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to reproducibility, we think the way to solve the reproducibility crisis is to build a new peer review system that (a) crowd-sources peer review from the academic community and (b) provides credit to material that journals don&#x27;t publish (data-sets, code, replications, failed replications).<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (a) and (b). We realize that addressing reproducibility is a huge challenge. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $28 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

If you like the idea of hacking on our (C++) encoder&#x2F;decoder, learning assembly for a new instruction set to optimise porting to a new hardware platform, then spending the next week helping us analyse, process and revitalise the back catalogs of the world&#x27;s top record labels...we want to hear from you. DSP wizardry not required (although obviously it&#x27;s nice!).<p>MQA has developed a music encoding and delivery system whose quality blows basically anything commercially available out of the water. (Think it&#x27;s impossible to do better than CD? So did a lot of people. If you want to help out with the peer-reviewed double-blind studies that proved them wrong - published in the field&#x27;s top journals - here&#x27;s the place to do it.) MQA is an end-to-end system, that ensures precise transmission of the analog signal (digital fidelity is only half the story) from the mastering desk to the listener&#x27;s ears. We&#x27;ve signed with household-name record labels, artists and hi-fi manufacturers, we&#x27;ve got music-industry luminaries working here (they&#x27;re remarkably nice to work with), and it&#x27;s only getting bigger from here.\nWe&#x27;re a friendly, international team that values initiative and getting things done, and we&#x27;re looking forward to meeting you.

We combine data science and a whatsapp like experience on the mobile to build a credit experience that is easy to use.. and yet manage a very sophisticated lending and recon pipeline.<p>India is a trillion dollar economy - probably, the second fastest growing economy in the world. We have the fastest growing smartphone userbase.. yet 95% of retail (including e-commerce!) is cash based . The single biggest reason is lack of credit infrastructure - systems like social security number, credit bureaus, etc either do not exist... or are just beginning to take shape.<p>The need for credit is massive - however the mechanism to originate and manage risk is missing. And that&#x27;s what RedCarpetUp seeks to solve.<p>&gt; Data Science\nWe are looking for our chief data scientist who can set the culture and goalposts around our data science. We are looking for someone who has experience around financial data science (hedge fund, banks, trading systems... Palantir?) and has appetite for graph based analytics.<p>We are looking for you to build the data science from a validation point-of-view. We will invest a lot of effort into building domain specific backtester... we just dont want to throw algorithms at the wall. We want to have a thoughtful and reasoned out approach towards this.<p>We do not expect you to be a production quality coder - we already have a team of data engineers who will translate your concepts into production code. But you will need to be able to express your thoughts as R or Python Notebooks.<p>&gt; UX<p>We are looking for a UX designer who is focused on the Android platform (oh yeah... those design guidelines).

Because the most clinically complicated cases in a patient population tend to drive a majority of the costs, even seemingly small improvements in these patients\u2019 well-being have dramatic benefits for the care provider. Wellframe focuses on improving patient health by providing personalized and adaptive care programs for people trying to recover from or manage serious health problems. We use the health data we collect in order to intelligently allot care resources to the specific needs of patients, paying special attention to the most-critical patients. Through clinical studies and working with large healthcare payers, we have seen that our platform improves patient outcomes, increases the capacity of care management teams and reduces costs of the care provider.\nWe have a relatively small engineering team at about 10 engineers. What makes us unique is that we have a full time clinical team of doctors that work with us to break down clinical science so that we can build it back up into personalized and adaptive care programs.<p>We&#x27;re currently looking for several mid&#x2F;senior engineering positions (android, iOS, frontend, infra&#x2F;platform, sre) across our engineering team. More descriptions can be found on our jobs page (below). If you&#x27;re in the area I&#x27;d love to just grab coffee regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re actively looking to move -- I love talking to other passionate, driven people about what they do.<p>Our stack is native Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C), our API is served in a Ruby on Rails monolith and Scala services, on top of MySQL, Cassandra, ElasticSearch and Spark. We are especially focusing on expanding our frontend team as we see significant growth on that side of the product. We are mostly Backbone + React, although some more complex state we are moving to Redux. It&#x27;s a very exciting time for the frontend, as we are planning to grow both in scale in terms of patient populations, as well as product use cases that require diverse interactions. It is super rewarding to see our product affect real people&#x27;s lives and the opportunity to reinvent this massive industry is enormous.<p>Jobs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wellframe.com&#x2F;jobs</a> Also feel free to reach out to me at nam@wellframe.com!",

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:\n- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.\n- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our next trip is January 2017...hello southern hemisphere!\n- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.\n- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?\nThere are probably many ways to do that.

Our engineers combine creativity, curiosity, and drive to continuously perfect and revolutionize Jet from the inside out. We are looking to bring more intellectually curious engineers who are passionate about technology in general (Jet is a technology first company and prides itself on its culture of learning and knowledge sharing and we want all our engineers to be as passionate as we are!)<p>Our platform is largely an event driven platform implemented via a microservice architecture. The platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses a large number of technologies and middle ware. The bulk of backend code is written in a functional style (F#) and our system of record is an event sourced system (essentially a log of all actions on the platform). We use a mix of Kafka, Redis, Elastic Search, Azure SQL, Event Store and Azure Storage for our data stores. About 50% of the platform runs on Linux and the rest Windows (although we move into more containerization we will see a shift towards Linux).<p>----------<p>I&#x27;ve been working at Jet since mid-February, and I can honestly say this is the best job I&#x27;ve ever had. It personally checks off every single box I could have a for a dream job:<p>- Incredible growth. We were the fastest startup to hit a billion dollar valuation, and we just got bought by Walmart for 3.3 billion. With the Fortune 1 at our backs there are some really amazing opportunities and projects that are just getting started.<p>- Functional programming in F#. Never been more productive coding. And in general we have a very modern tech stack that is a pleasure to work with.<p>- Tech talks and workshops all the time. I&#x27;m learning more than I ever have.<p>- Extremely competent management. It feels like they really care about employees&#x27; happiness here, we&#x27;ve got experienced people at the helm, and it is amazing to see what a company can look like when you have a fantastic management team bringing their A-game. Really, it&#x27;s incredible to have to try hard to find something to complain about.<p>- All the trappings of modern startup life. Free gym membership, lots of free food, etc.<p>We&#x27;re hiring people of all different types of experience for all different types of roles.

While DNA sequencing technology has advanced rapidly, it\u2019s still at a level equivalent to what assembly language was to computing. With huge advances yet to be made, we&#x27;re creating products that will do for sequencing what C did for computing which enable scientists to gain higher-order clarity and meaning to what is now very low-level information. Software is a key part of that leap. There&#x27;s no shortage of difficult problems due to the scale and complexity of analyzing, managing, and visualizing sequencing data. Thoughtful and elegant software engineering can yield big payoffs.<p>Our software and instruments are used at top research institutions and hospitals around the world. 10x Genomics has most recently raised a $55M Series C from Fidelity and SoftBank and has about 130 employees in Pleasanton, San Francisco, and in the field across the world.\nYou can view a demo of an existing piece of visualization software at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;loupe.10xgenomics.com&#x2F;loupe&#x2F;</a>, or read about (and run if you&#x27;d like) our massively parallel pipelines at <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.10xgenomics.com</a>.
