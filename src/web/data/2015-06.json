In the process, we learned a ton about the world of government software. Many people know about the disastrous Healthcare.gov launch, but there's a long list of huge technical problems that impact everyone in the US. A few examples: people are dying because the Veteran's Administration is six months behind in processing claims, the IRS system goes down for regular maintenance every night, and the Social Security Administration is still paying benefits to millions of deceased Americans because their data is so poorly managed.</p><p>Over the past year, our team has seen an opportunity to create software that radically improves how our government serves its people, and we've started our company, Nava, to chase that vision.</p><p>You probably remember the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, but you might not have seen our relaunch in the news. That\u2019s a good thing. Here are a few facts we can share: our new insurance application is processing 70% of all apps coming through the marketplace, converts 35% more people than the old app, gets them through in half the time, and is mobile-friendly (20% of applications were started on mobile). App 2.0 was the first system that CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) ever hosted on Amazon AWS, and the login system we just launched saves taxpayers $70 million a year. (Here's a Wired article from last summer about us: <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/</a>)</p><p>We\u2019re continuing to rebuild and improve Healthcare.gov while expanding in bold new directions, bringing talented engineers (we're mainly Stanford, Google, and Y Combinator alums) to DC, the place where we're needed most. If you'd like to build software that reimagines how millions of Americans interact with their government, we\u2019d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com.</p><p>Specifically, we\u2019re looking for:\n- a product manager with a technical background\n- senior devops engineers\n- senior full-stack engineers</p></font>\n              ",

The internet is full of bad guys trying to trick unsuspecting users and make a quick buck. Our mission is simple: Clean up the internet. We're a small company and the only way we can deliver on this mission is if everyone we hire is talented, passionate, and committed to doing things the right way.</p><p>We do a lot of web crawling to trace the flow of web traffic, or identify places where their brand is being used incorrectly or inappropriately in specific offers, free form text, or even images. Directing a crawl against big chunks of the web and filtering the results to find the needle in the internet haystack has many challenges, and certainly puts our core work in the \"Big Data\" realm.</p><p>We're looking for an experienced engineer who is a strong individual contributor but also wants to share their experience with some extremely capable but more junior team members. We\u2019re very collaborative, and our engineers are some of the best communicating people around, because we appreciate that even if you can solve a problem well, being able to communicate about it is just as important.\nThe strong developer we\u2019re seeking will have the foundations to easily adapt to a new stack, so we\u2019re not looking for specific skill buzzwords. Experience with Python, AWS, and non-relational data storage would help you ramp up faster, but we\u2019re willing to invest the time if you come with the right stuff but not the same stack.</p><p>If this sounds worth having a conversation about, please drop us a line at jobs@brandverity.com</p></font>\n              ",

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive:  that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past.  At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems.  We are looking for more people like us:  systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source.  We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem.  We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed.  And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.</p><p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely).  We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house).

On the schools\u2019 side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they\u2019re purchasing.

Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they\u2019re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they\u2019ve learned across multiple apps.</p><p>We\u2019re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.

In addition to the conventional Rails work, you'd get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala.

This month, there will not be a post from Matasano Security.  Effective today, there will no longer be a Matasano Security.  Instead, we're officially rebranding as NCC Group.</p><p>In late 2012, Matasano was acquired by NCC Group joining iSEC Partners and later Intrepidus Group.  Since that time, we've been working together, cross staffing projects and benefiting from each other\u2019s expertise.  It's been a slow, steady process of increasing cohesion.  We've reached the point where we need to assume a single identity, that of NCC Group.</p><p>Being a part of this process as it unfolds reminds me a bit of watching the Voltron cartoon series as a child in the '80s.  The show featured pilots each commanding their own robot lions.  Robot lions are fierce, powerful beings.  But when they came together they'd form Voltron - a giant humanoid robot with the lions compromising each of it's parts.  I like to think this is what's happening at NCC Group.  What were previously separate companies each well accomplished in computer security are becoming a single even more formidable entity. \"Form arms and body! And, I'll form the head!\"</p><p>So, what does this have to do with hiring?</p><p>Growing a larger company requires a larger number of individuals.  We still need candidates with the same skills as always; programming, reverse engineering, protocol analysis, web application building/breaking, adversarial thinking.  We need people who understand technology and can identify flaws in how it's implemented.  We need those who can look at a security weakness, and accurately gauge it's relative risk to the organization.  And we need folks who can communicate that risk to multiple audiences, in varying levels of detail.</p><p>There's no better time than now to join us.  Our integration effort has opened up opportunity within the company to focus on areas of specialization, advance skills, and take on ever more complex projects and challenges.  If you've always wanted to be part of something new, but found yourself averse to the risk of early stage start ups, joining us now might be a way to do both.  We're stable but we're evolving and changing, and our employees will shape what we become.</p><p>If you want to learn more about us check out our:\n   Blog - <a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/blog/</a>\n   Cryptopals - <a href=\"http://cryptopals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cryptopals.com/</a>\n   Microcorruption - <a href=\"http://microcorruption.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://microcorruption.com/</a></p><p>If you're ready to apply, contact us at:\n   <a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/careers/</a></p><p>Please, bear with us on the sites above.

Not Silicon Valley. Not even really tech. But cool :)</p><p>GDC (<a href=\"http://www.gothamdreamcars.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gothamdreamcars.com</a>) is an ultra-exotic car rental company.  I started it about 11 years ago and have built it organically to a multi-city company renting out some of the coolest cars on earth.</p><p>A few years ago I dove headfirst into the tech side of things, taught myself to code, brushed off the 'ol design skills, and built our entire tech stack myself - and it now runs the whole company. But I'm focused on other things these days and don't have the time to maintain / continue to develop the site, so it's time to bring someone on board to handle it.</p><p>It's not the most world-changing stuff -- essentially a CRUD app with a consumer-facing frontend and admin-facing backend for managing the fleet, booking reservations, doing light CRM, billing, logistics, etc. But it's incredibly satisfying to work on -- every feature directly helps the employees in the office work more efficiently, helps the cars get booked more often, and helps our customers stay happy. It's step-by-step replacing manual processes and has a huge impact on the company, employees and customers.</p><p>If you're looking for some satisfying part-time, remote Rails + Frontend work and are interested in directly improving an interesting business that deals with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, this might be ideal for you. There's zero overhead here -- if you have an idea for a feature, you can go ahead code it up and push it live that day.</p><p>You don't have to be a senior Rails or JavaScript expert - you just have to be better than I am ;) (I'm a solid intermediate.)  But please do have experience with Rails - I'd prefer to work with someone who can hit the ground running.</p><p>There's a long list of fun features on my to-do list, so the first few weeks/months would be more involved as you bang out updates and get things caught up, then it would transition to maintenance, new features, new ideas, etc. over time.  I expect needing ~30 hrs/week for the first few months and then scaling down to 10-20 hrs/week.</p><p>Note I'm pretty serious about \"full stack\" here -- I've been a one-man band the past few years and you're effectively going to replace me in day-to-day stuff, so while you don't need to be a pro graphic designer too, you should have some basic design skills since it's all you.  I'll still be here and can certainly help in this area, but I'm going to lean on you for a majority of the heavy lifting.</p><p>A bit about our stack and some of the tasks at hand:</p><p>* Rails (currently on 3.2, moving to 4.x)\n* MongoDB (but that's gotta go, so we're moving to Postgres)\n* Stylus for CSS (not wedded to it - open to SASS/LESS if it makes sense)\n* Haml / Slim for HTML templates\n* JavaScript (currently mess of jQuery - TBD which framework we'll move to)\n* Git-based workflow</p><p>If this sounds interesting/fun and you like the idea of taking ownership over a live web app from top to bottom, take a look at the site, shoot me an email (contact info in HN profile) and we'll discuss.</p></font>\n              ",

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.</p><p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=\"http://we.are.expensify.com/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).\nWe are excited to hear from you!</p></font>\n              ",
